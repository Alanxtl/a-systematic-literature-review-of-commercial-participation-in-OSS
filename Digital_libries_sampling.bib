abstract = {Scientific open-source software (scientific OSS) has facilitated scientific research due to its transparent and collaborative nature. The sustainability of such software is becoming crucial given its pivotal role in scientific endeavors. While past research has proposed strategies for the sustainability of the scientific software or general OSS communities in isolation, it remains unclear when the two scenarios are merged if these approaches are directly applicable to developing scientific OSS. In this research, we propose to investigate the unique challenges in sustaining the scientific OSS ecosystems. We first conduct a case study to empirically understand the interdisciplinary team's collaboration in scientific OSS ecosystems and identify the collaboration challenges. Further, to generalize our findings, we plan to conduct a large-scale quantitative study in broader scientific OSS ecosystems to identify the cross-project collaboration inefficiencies. Finally, we would like to design and develop interventions to mitigate the problems identified.},

abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) has come to play a critical role in the software industry. Some large ecosystems enjoy the participation of large numbers of companies, each of which has its own focus and goals. Indeed, companies that otherwise compete, may become collaborators within the OSS ecosystem they participate in. Prior research has largely focused on commercial involvement in OSS projects, but there is a scarcity of research focusing on company collaborations within OSS ecosystems. Some of these ecosystems have become critical building blocks for organizations worldwide; hence, a clear understanding of how companies collaborate within large ecosystems is essential. This paper presents the results of an empirical study of the OpenStack ecosystem, in which hundreds of companies collaborate on thousands of project repositories to deliver cloud distributions. Based on a detailed analysis, we identify clusters of collaborations, and identify four strategies that companies adopt to engage with the OpenStack ecosystem. We alsofind that companies may engage in intentional or passive collaborations, or may work in an isolated fashion. Further, wefi nd that a company's position in the collaboration network is positively associated with its productivity in OpenStack. Our study sheds light on how large OSS ecosystems work, and in particular on the patterns of collaboration within one such large ecosystem.},

abstract = {Agile and DevOps are widely adopted by the industry. Hence, integrating security activities with industrial practices, such as continuous integration (CI) pipelines, is necessary to detect security flaws and adhere to regulators' demands early. In this paper, we analyze automated security activities in CI pipelines of enterprise-driven open source software (OSS). This shall allow us, in the long-run, to better understand the extent to which security activities are (or should be) part of automated pipelines. In particular, we mine publicly available OSS repositories and survey a sample of project maintainers to better understand the role that security activities and their related tools play in their CI pipelines. To increase transparency and allow other researchers to replicate our study (and to take different perspectives), we further disclose our research artefacts.Our results indicate that security activities in enterprise-driven OSS projects are scarce and protection coverage is rather low. Only 6.83\% of the analyzed 8,243 projects apply security automation in their CI pipelines, even though maintainers consider security to be rather important. This alerts industry to keep the focus on vulnerabilities of 3rd Party software and it opens space for other improvements of practice which we outline in this manuscript.},

abstract = {Corporate participation plays an increasing role in Open Source Software (OSS) development. Unlike volunteers in OSS projects, companies are driven by business objectives. To pursue corporate interests, companies may try to dominate the development direction of OSS projects. One company's domination in OSS may 'crowd out' other contributors, changing the nature of the project, and jeopardizing the sustainability of the OSS ecosystem. Prior studies of corporate involvement in OSS have primarily focused on predominately positive aspects such as business strategies, contribution models, and collaboration patterns. However, there is a scarcity of research on the potential drawbacks of corporate engagement. In this paper, we investigate corporate dominance in OSS ecosystems. We draw on the field of Economics and quantify company domination using a dominance measure; we investigate the prevalence, patterns, and impact of domination in the evolution of the OpenStack ecosystem. We find evidence of company domination in over 73\% of the repositories in OpenStack, and approximately 25\% of companies dominate one or more repositories per version. We identify five patterns of corporate dominance: Early incubation, Full-time hosting, Growing domination, Occasional domination, and Last remaining. We find that domination has a significantly negative relationship with the survival probability of OSS projects. This study provides insights for building sustainable relationships between companies and the OSS ecosystems in which they seek to get involved.},

We provide these as a dataset detailing their provenance and properties. A manual evaluation of a dataset sample shows an identification accuracy of 89\%. Through an exploratory data analysis we found that projects are staffed by a plurality of enterprise insiders, who appear to be pulling more than their weight, and that in a small percentage of relatively large projects development happens exclusively through enterprise insiders.},

abstract = {IntroductionWe define corporate open source (COS) as applying the precepts and methodologies prevalent in the open source development community for creating industrial-strength software projects in a corporation for internal use. It may seem that open source style development - using informal processes, voluntary assignment to tasks, and having few financial incentives - may not be a good match for commercial environments. Our ongoing work, however, demonstrates that under the right circumstances, corporations can benefit from open source development techniques. We present two approaches to managing COS projects, and expand in detail on one of them. Our results indicate that open source approaches require significant adaptation to succeed in commercial settings. In particular, they require substantial support from business divisions within a corporation to successfully leverage the shared asset.Our ongoing research has attempted to determine whether corporations can effectively leverage the open source development model to create and manage software projects inside the corporate domain. We have observed how the precepts and methodologies of the open source development had to be adapted in order to create commercial grade software. In particular changes are required in order to accommodate a market-driven schedule and feature decisions that are not wholly amenable to an open source development approach. Our contributions in this article include describing two methods to effectively manage COS assets: an Infrastructure-based COS model, and a Project-specific COS model. We report experiences with the management aspects of the latter COS model, which includes our findings that this model requires a greater amount of support to get a new business division onboard when compared to the minimal support provided by traditional open source projects. However, the benefits of Project-specific COS outweigh the costs once the business division is fully on-board: the development costs are amortized over the number of divisions using the common asset, and the asset itself benefits from contributions from the expanded use.Open source practices and tools have proven potential to overcome many of the well-known difficulties of geographically distributed software development, and to allow widely distributed users of software to add features and functionality they want with a minimum of conflict and management overhead.Dinkelacker et al. discuss Progressive Open Source as a set of tools and techniques for a corporation to host multiple open source projects within a company and between third parties. In the context of their work, our work on COS corresponds to and furthers their work on what is referred to as "Inner Source" in their paper.Our previous work attempted to determine whether open source tools and practices are a good fit for developing commercial-grade software especially in the light of the differences between the two camps: open source development is more iterative in nature when compared to the staged method of software development practiced at many corporations; the incentive structure between the two varies, as does the motivation factor; commercial software is usually characterized by process methodologies (CMMI, ISO, TL9000, among others), that are typically absent in open source development. We reached the conclusion that certain commercial projects can indeed benefit from open source development methodology, especially those projects where:• a technology is needed by several product groups (hence there is reason to pool resources),• the technology is relatively immature so that requirements and features are not fully known at the outset (so there is a need to evolve continuously),• product groups have different needs and specific expertise in customizing the software for their needs (so everyone benefits from the contributions of each group), and• the initial product has a sound, modular architecture (so that it is feasible to merge all the diverse changes into a single development branch).Furthering our previous work, the discussion in this article presents a management view of maintaining a COS asset. We discuss project management and planning aspects that are intrinsic to projects managed in this style.},

abstract = {IntroductionPerhaps the business case for adopting open source software is an easy sell. After all, the software is free, and can be simply downloaded from the Internet and installed or customized as needed. Organizations interested in reducing the licensing fees of proprietary software, while also avoiding the penalties and legal liabilities associated with their illegal use, can definitely consider open source software a plausible alternative. However, less obvious than the cost savings but equally important are the barriers ("hidden costs") of adopting open source software.Open source software has created considerable excitement in the business world over the last decade. These applications, designed by groups of volunteer software developers, have the potential to break the current dominance of proprietary software and restrictive licenses for many business applications, reduce software development time and improve software quality, and most importantly, bring much needed software applications within the reach of individuals and small businesses, who cannot otherwise afford such software. Further, unlike proprietary software, open source software applications make their source code available for free, which can be customized to fit the unique needs of specific organizations.Many organizations have caught on to open source software and realized significant cost savings in technology expenditure as a result. For instance, Cendant Travel Distribution Services replaced a $100 million mainframe system with a $2.5 million system running on 144 Linux servers. Amazon.com cut its technology expenditure from $71 million to $54 million by switching to open source applications. Sabre Holdings saved tens of millions of dollars by adopting MySQL, an open source database product. Though the basic open source software is free, the prospect of paid ancillary products and services such as hardware and consulting has motivated many erstwhile proprietary technology vendors such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Sun Microsystems to embrace open source software and offer value-added services based on such software.Table 1 shows an estimated range of the current global market share of several of today's open source software applications. This table shows that though the open source market is large and growing for some application domains such as Web server (such as Apache), server operating systems (such as Linux Server), database server (such as MySQL), electronic mail client (such as Sendmail), and Internet browser (such as Firefox), it is lagging behind its proprietary counterparts in other domains such as client operating systems (such as Linux Workstation), office productivity software (such as OpenOffice), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This pattern suggests that there may be significant barriers to open source software adoption among some sectors of the user populations.It is widely believed that proprietary software vendors often use fear, uncertainty and doubt to undermine and cut the market potential of their open source competitors. The objective of this paper is to reduce that uncertainty via a candid discussion of the barriers confronting open source software adoption and potential remedies to those barriers. These barriers and their remedies, summarized in Table 2, are discussed in detail.},

One major limitation of the current OSS tools and platforms is that they provide a uniform user interface regardless of the activities performed by the various types of contributors. This paper serves as a non-trivial first step towards resolving this challenge by demonstrating a methodology and establishing knowledge to understand how the contributors' roles and their dynamics, reflected in the activities contributors perform, are exhibited in OSS communities. Based on an analysis of user action data from 29 GitHub projects, we extracted six activities that distinguished four Active roles and five Supporting roles of OSS contributors, as well as patterns in role changes. Through the lens of the Activity Theory, these findings provided rich design guidelines for OSS tools to support diverse contributor roles.},

This paper proposes a new direction for OSS product success research: examination of firm-oriented factors. This has gained importance with the emergence of firm-sponsored OSS communities and firm's collaboration with OSS communities. This conceptual position paper uses absorptive capacity theory as a basis for argument. The paper contributes by extending the work on OSS product success to firm-oriented factors.},

Although the benefits of improving computing education with open source practices are largely acknowledged, transforming teaching to create effective learning environments has many challenges. The panelists will bring different perspectives on teaching strategies and curricular content they have used in their classrooms. These perspectives will exemplify key issues with FOSS-based education and FOSS-based IT systems. The developer and user communities established around FOSS-based IT systems are of particular interest to the IT discipline because of its focus on user centeredness and advocacy for advancing professional practices in authentic environments.},

abstract = {A common refrain from Senior Exit Surveys and Alumni Surveys is the desire to work on "real-world," "practical" and "hands-on" projects using industry-ready tools and development environments. To assuage this, institutions have moved towards adopting Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) as an avenue to provide meaningful, applied learning interventions to students. Through these experiences, students benefit from engagement with various communities including: the community of contributors to the FOSS project; the community of local software developers; the community of citizens who reside in the local area; the community of students at their institution and others; and, the community of people impacted by the FOSS project. These engagements motivate students, enhance their communication and technical skills, allow them to grow and become more confident, help them form professional networks, and provide the "real-world" projects they seek. In this panel, we will discuss our experiences in engaging students with five different types of communities as part of incorporating FOSS into our courses, focusing on how other educators can provide the same benefits to their students as well. In order to satisfy the time constraints of the panel, the last two authors will present together.},

publisher = {Society for Modeling \&amp; Simulation International},
address = {Vista, CA},
abstract = {One of the major challenges the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Ground Forces (GF) Battle Lab (BL) has been facing in recent years is the introduction of new simulation technologies and methods, under tight development schedule constraints. Introducing new technologies requires a "proof of concept" process in order to decide on the profitability of further development. Using Open Source software solutions in the BL helped make this process quicker and more efficient.The BL has been developing its proprietary Computer Generated Forces (CGF) for approximately 10 years. This CGF is mainly intended for simulating ground entities and has various capabilities for autonomous movement. Over the years, as the visual systems have improved and due to the introduction of urban environments simulation, the need for realistic movement characteristics, especially human, became important. An in-house solution, developed by the CGF team, appeared to consume too much development effort and was not extendable enough. After analyzing the problem and reviewing various third-party solutions, the CGF team decided on using an Open Source (OS) library called OpenSteer.Until recently, ground vehicle simulations in the BL used a low fidelity non-physical movement mode, based on ground clamping. In 2006 the BL got involved in research areas related to Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and human-robotics interactions. During early research stages it became clear that it would be necessary to simulate the UGV dynamics in higher fidelity than was done before. The development team decided to initiate the "proof of concept" process before full scale development. Therefore a quick solution for a high-fidelity vehicle simulation was searched for. After a brief review of third party solutions, an OS library, Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) was chosen. Developing a UGV simulation required an autonomous movement model which appeared to have similar characteristics to the one developed by the CGF team based on OpenSteer. Since OpenSteer was not originally intended for simulating rigid-body vehicles, the development team faced the challenge of integrating both products, OpenSteer and ODE. This paper will describe the steps taken in order to assimilate OS products in the BL simulation test-bed and lessons learned.},

However, its diffusion in South Africa has been rather slow. This research aims to highlight OSS adoption factors applicable to small enterprises. The Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework was used to guide the data analysis. This research also attempts to identify additional factors which are unique to the context of this research and evaluate their implication on the OSS adoption decision.Although there are many factors influencing the adoption decision by smaller enterprises, the lack of knowledge and exposure were fundamental to the slow diffusion of OSS. Factors contributing to this lack of product knowledge were the lack of OSS marketing and easily accessible OSS vendors.},

The business model, a powerful tool for extracting economic value from the potential of technological innovation, clearly plays an important role in the success of a business. In this paper we investigate the role of open source in the business models of Red Hat and IBM and describe how OSS has contributed to their success.

abstract = {The usage of Open Source Software (OSS) has been more general these days and OSS are utilized in a wide range of business fields not only IT industries. Behind the expansion, there exist OSS development communities, where voluntary engineers dedicate their time and effort for the improvement. Considering development engineers in the companies as input resources, it is important to investigate the output of business growth. In this study, we conducted questionnaire survey to Japanese IT companies in 2013, and then analyzed the present state and relation between OSS utilization and development contribution. Our study revealed that Japanese IT companies are rather free riders of OSS, the volume of development contributions are far less than that of utilization. With regard to the effect on the business growth, the results of correlation analysis implicate that OSS utilization is related to the sales growth in the present term and that development contribution is related to the future growth of the employee number in the company. In order to explore the direct effect on the business growth, we constructed the models of multiple-logistic and logistic analyses, however, no direct and explicit determinants are found from the results of the analyses. Our research endeavors to investigate the OSS effect on the business growth are still on the way, but it is meaningful to provide the present state in numbers and hopefully this will lay some foundation for further study in this field.},

abstract = {Sustainable Open Source Software (OSS) forms much of the fabric of our digital society, especially successful and sustainable ones. But many OSS projects do not become sustainable, resulting in abandonment and even risks for the world's digital infrastructure. Prior work has looked at the reasons for this mainly from two very different perspectives. In software engineering, the focus has been on understanding success and sustainability from the socio-technical perspective: the OSS programmers' day-to-day activities and the artifacts they create. In institutional analysis, on the other hand, emphasis has been on institutional designs (e.g., policies, rules, and norms) that structure project governance. Even though each is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of OSS projects, the connection and interaction between the two approaches have been barely explored.In this paper, we make the first effort toward understanding OSS project sustainability using a dual-view analysis, by combining institutional analysis with socio-technical systems analysis. In particular, we (i) use linguistic approaches to extract institutional rules and norms from OSS contributors' communications to represent the evolution of their governance systems, and (ii) construct socio-technical networks based on longitudinal collaboration records to represent each project's organizational structure. We combined the two methods and applied them to a dataset of developer digital traces from 253 nascent OSS projects within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator. We find that the socio-technical and institutional features relate to each other, and provide complimentary views into the progress of the ASF's OSS projects. Refining these combined analyses can help provide a more precise understanding of the synchronization between the evolution of institutional governance and organizational structure.},

abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) has become the subject of much commercial and academic interest in last few years. As traditional software, OSS also evolves to fulfill the need of stakeholders. Therefore, providing quantitative metrics for OSS evolution has also become an urgent issue. However, most existing studies of software evolution have been performed on systems developed within a single company using traditional management techniques. These metrics models are inadequate to measure OSS evolution. In this paper, we describe a preliminary evolution metrics set for evaluating OSS. The most significant novelty of this model is that it takes specific properties of Open Source Community (OSC) into consideration. In another word, we measure the evolution of OSS and OSC together. We also provide a lightweight case study on Ubuntu project using this metrics set. We find out that the Open Source Community and its members also play essential role in OSS evolution. We expect this metrics model can bring better understandings and explanations of phenomena in open source development and evolution.},

We leverage the full history of developers’ interactions with their teammates and projects at github.com between January 2010 and April 2017 (representing about 133 million interactions) to establish that – contrary to a common narrative describing open source as a pure “technical meritocracy” – developers’ communication abilities and community building skills are significant predictors of whether they emerge as team leaders. Inspirational communication therefore appears as central to the process of leader emergence in virtual teams, even in a setting like OSS, where technical contributions have often been conceptualized as the sole pathway to gaining community recognition. Those results should be of interest to researchers and practitioners theorizing about OSS in particular and, more generally, leadership in geographically dispersed virtual teams, as well as to online community managers.},

Despite these efforts, empirical studies show only minor adoption of such methods. To understand how research can contribute to improving the selection of components we interviewed developers from 16 Norwegian software companies which integrate Open Source Software (OSS) components into their systems. We find that the selection of OSS components has a situational nature where project specific properties significantly constrain the selection's outcome, and that developers employ a ‘first fit’ rather than ‘best fit’ approach when selecting OSS components. This could explain the limited adoption of normative selection approaches and general evaluation schemas. Moreover, it motivates a shift from developing such methods and schemas towards understanding the situational nature of software selection.},

The Teaching Open Source (http://teachingopensource.org) community is an emergent (3 year old) group working on scaffolding to bridge the cultural differences between academic and FOSS communities of practice. Join us to share questions, challenges, and triumphs of incorporating FOSS participation into existing and new curricula as well support resources for doing so. Alumni and current members of the POSSE (Professors' Open Source Summer Experience, http://communityleadershipteam.org/posse) will attend in mentorship roles. Faculty attendance at the SIGCSE 2010 BoF on Teaching Open Source (TOS) indicates that student involvement in FOSS projects is a teaching and learning approach of interest for many faculty members. The transparency of both artifacts and process make FOSS an attractive real-world experience that enhances peer learning and intrinsic motivation for a diversity of courses, from introductory, interdisciplinary, and non-major classes to software engineering core offerings and senior capstones. However, such student participation involves a significant learning curve and effort on the part of the faculty member, and support structures for faculty are still maturing. 2011-2012 marks the 3rd academic year the TOS community has explored this realm together, and the past year has seen the emergence of more best practices, support resources, and curricular material. Community members are starting to design cross-institutional research on the impact of FOSS participation on students. BoF attendees will be encouraged to ask questions, network, and take advantage of the TOS community as a support structure for their own courses and projects.The audience is expected to consist of instructors who 1) are interested in learning how to get started in involving students in FOSS projects; or 2) have involved students in FOSS projects and are looking for better ways to facilitate student learning within FOSS projects.},

One way this problem can be mitigated is by growing student-oriented open source projects within academia while still involving real world clients. One such project, called Homebase, involved a team of students working with a local Ronald McDonald House to develop volunteer scheduling software. In true open source fashion, this project has since been extended over a number of course iterations, with different clients, and has been adopted at other schools. In this paper, we report on our experiences using this approach for similar projects at three quite different schools, and discuss ways to adapt and enhance this approach for differing student populations.},

The reliability assessment of OSS has become an important issue. However, due to the lack of a standardized development process and uncertain number of participating developers, it is hard to measure the reliability of OSS compared to closed source software. This paper proposes a framework for reliability automatic assessment of OSS based on JIRA. It contains the failure data acquisition module, the reliability modeling module, and the reliability attribute analysis module. The proposed framework is applied on popular OSS Kafka to assess its reliability. The experimental results are compared with previous work related to OSS reliability assessment and show that the proposed framework is good for the reliability assessment of OSS.},

Behind this current situation, there are tremendous inputs by the volunteer engineers in the development communities. In this series of studies, we have conducted questionnaire survey to Japanese IT companies in 2012 and 2013, and then analyzed the relation between OSS utilization and development contribution, and how these affect the business growth. Our study revealed that Japanese IT companies are rather free riders of OSS, the volume of development contributions are far less than that of utilization. From our previous studies, it was anticipated that some OSS-related factors were affecting the business growth; however, clear evidence has not been found. In autumn 2014, we conducted the questionnaire survey for the third time and this paper presents the survey results as the second report of the continued research. We constructed the simplified Logistic Model to investigate the influential factors on business growth. However, no clear evidence was found as the same as the previous study. In summary, we conclude that there are some form of relationships between OSS utilization and development contribution, but these are not the determinant factors on the business growth in the Japanese IT companies at present.},

We report findings from an interview-based study with contributors and maintainers working in a wide range of F/OSS projects. Maintainers of F/OSS projects do not just maintain software code in a more traditional software engineering understanding of the term: fixing bugs, patching security vulnerabilities, and updating dependencies. F/OSS maintainers also perform complex and often-invisible interpersonal and organizational work to keep their projects operating as active communities of users and contributors. We particularly focus on how this labor of maintaining and sustaining changes as projects and their software grow and scale across many dimensions. In understanding F/OSS to be as much about maintaining a communal project as it is maintaining software code, we discuss broadly applicable considerations for peer production communities and other socio-technical systems more broadly.},

Maintaining these versions involves initiating the transfer of changes for reuse. In the context of a pull-based development model, where the development branch remains current, the term "backporting" is coined to sustain stable versions. Stability requirements may necessitate fewer changes, compatible modifications, or security checks. Consequently, we conducted an analysis of 37,460 backports from 223,602 pull requests in open-source GitHub projects, aiming to identify types of incompatibilities encountered in real-life scenarios. We manually pinpointed various reasons why pull requests may lack compatibility with other versions, including contextual differences, varying dependencies, and statement-level alterations. This study constitutes the inaugural comprehensive characterization of changesets during the porting process across different versions with incompatibilities. The acquired insights can serve as a foundation for automated slicing and adaptation of changesets in stable software versions.},

Second, I will recount the collaboration effort that we had with our large clients and the various milestones we achieved during that process. I will explain the goals regarding big data analysis that our large clients presented to us and how we accomplished those goals. In particular, I will discuss how we leveraged open source to deliver a real-time decisioning software product called Fatafat to these institutions. An advantage of developing applications in Fatafat is that it is already integrated with Hadoop, Kafka for real-time data streaming, HBase and Cassandra for NoSQL data storage. I will talk about how these companies benefited from Fatafat and some of challenges we had in the design of this software. I will provide quantifiable improvements in key metrics driven by Fatafat and interesting, unsolved problems/challenges that need to be addressed for faster and wider adoption of OSS by these companies.},

The use of Business Intelligence (BI) tools can contribute to the improvement of the organizational processes of these organizations. However, the high financial cost, in many cases, makes it impossible for public institutions to acquire proprietary BI solutions. An alternative is the use of solutions based on free and/or open source software. To identify, among the available OSS-based BI tools, which is the most appropriate for implementation in public bodies, it is necessary to apply some specific model for evaluation and selection. The literature describes several generic methods for assessing and comparing OSS. In this work, we select a suitable method and derive a model for the comparison and selection of OSS-based BI tools able to meet the demands of public organizations. In addition, through a case study, we demonstrate how this model can be used in the selection of a tool that can contribute to the improvement of information management in an organizational environment.},

abstract = {Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) is a category of free and open source software that improves the human condition. HFOSS projects focus on a range of societal needs including microfinance, healthcare, education, and disaster relief. Many HFOSS projects are developed by international teams whose goal is to make the world a better place. These projects are often primarily used in developing nations, but many have been adopted across the world because of the robustness of the software and the ability to contribute to its direction and applications.HFOSS projects have been successfully infused into the computing curriculum at a number of institutions in a range of ways and courses [1]. The benefits of introducing students to HFOSS projects potentially includes improved students learning, increased motivation to study computing, attracting women to computing and increased appreciation of the societal impact of computing. HFOSS projects are an excellent real-world learning environment for a number of reasons:- The altruistic nature of HFOSS makes the community welcoming of new contributors and tolerant of student participation- The ability to help others is a potential draw for women and under-represented minorities- The transparency of HFOSS projects provides artifacts that can use for instructional purposes in the classroom- Students can build a visible portfolio of their contributions to show potential employers.However, determining which project to choose, how to incorporate HFOSS into a class and deciding how to assess students' participation, can be challenging. OpenFE is an NSF-funded project whose goal is to help faculty members introduce their students to HFOSS and become contributing members in HFOSS communities. Faculty typically start with choosing a project, then learning about the chosen project, getting up to speed on the tools and communication used by the project and getting a handle on the work flow. Then faculty members have to figure out how to integrate the project into their existing curriculum and determine how to assess the student performance. The goal of the OpenFE project is to help faculty through the hurdles presented by joining an HFOSS project.},

Survey data collected from 114 senior Information Technology (IT) managers and IT professionals indicates that an organization's perception of firm-specificity of OSS human capital and the extent of learning-related scale are positively associated with the investment it makes in cultivating internal OSS human capital. Additionally, we observed that learning-related scale moderates the impact of firm-specificity of OSS on its investment in human capital for OSS platform products.},

abstract = {A key component in successfully managing software products is to properly, and in a timely manner, identify and secure competitive advantage by innovation via feature differentiation. Although open source software (OSS) is not a new idea, several product development companies that operate in a market-driven context have started to use open source solutions as core software components in their products. Adopting open source core components implies a lower degree of control over software development and increased business risk associated with integrating differentiating contributions into the core release stream. Whether and how to adjust the current requirements management practices after the adoption of OSS components to fully benefit from the concept of open innovation has not yet been empirically explored. We outline experiences and challenges related to leveraging open innovation via engaging in OSS identified during 19 interviews with practitioners occupying different roles in the requirements management process at a large company followed by four validation interviews with other practitioners. We then propose a research agenda for requirements and decision management in the open innovation context and suggest which challenges in requirements engineering open innovation affects.},

The study builds on an existing body of work in student participation in HFOSS. Six institutions with a variety of profiles are involved in the study and the paper reports on quantitative analysis of Likert survey items. Results of Mann-Whitney U tests on Likert data are mixed. Positive results indicate that students perceived that participating in an HFOSS project made them more comfortable with computing and improved their perceived ability to maintain a project and interact with professionals. Negative results include a perceived decrease in perception of computing skills, which may result from an increased understanding of the complexity of developing a large, real-world project.},

Consequently, research emerged within Sustainable HCI, aiming to derive design principles that can empower these movements to scale their impact. However, a notable gap exists in contributions when addressing scalability of large free and open-source software (FOSS) projects.This paper aims to present our endeavors as action-oriented researchers with the voluntary-driven Foodsharing.de movement, focusing on a local community, the open-source developers and their connections. Within a community of 585,000 users and only a few developers that is dedicated to save and share surplus food, we explore the concepts of ‘intermediary experience’. We also introduce the notion of ‘serendipitous connections’, highlighting the unintentional yet beneficial associations that can arise from the collaboration between developers and users.},

The great density of information requires an efficient concept of data storage and management and an adequate means of presentation of high quality. The decision was made to develop a www-based information system based mainly on open source software modules. Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP as well as VRML-data format as open source components, were used for the information system; only the construction of the 3D-geometrical model was realized by means of commercial software. The 3D-model shows the different construction phases and depicts the reconstruction ideas at the respective different construction phases. Above all the 3D-model is the basis of joining the building information system to other sources of information, available in databases: the digital "Raumbuch", which contains all non-geometric information about the several rooms, archives of plans, drawings and photos, catalogues of the devices, brick stamps and constructions, as well as keys to literature and archives. The data storage, management and analysis are the central tasks of the project; realistic visualisation is secondary.},

abstract = {Past research established that individuals joining an Open Source community typically follow a socialization process called "the onion model": newcomers join a project by first contributing at the periphery through mailing list discussions and bug trackers and as they develop skill and reputation within the community they advance to central roles of contributing code and making design decisions. However, the modern Open Source landscape has fewer projects that operate independently and many projects under the umbrella of software ecosystems that bring together projects with common underlying components, technology, and social norms. Participants in such an ecosystems may be able to utilize a significant amount of transferrable knowledge when moving between projects in the ecosystem and, thereby, skip steps in the onion model. In this paper, we examine whether the onion model of joining and progressing in a standalone Open Source project still holds true in large project ecosystems and how the model might change in such settings.},

However, this information is becoming of major interest, especially ---but not only--- because of the growth in the number of companies for which FOSS has become relevant for their business strategy. In this paper we present a novel approach to estimate effort by considering data from source code management repositories. We apply our model to the OpenStack project, a FOSS project with more than 1,000 authors, in which several tens of companies cooperate. Based on data from its repositories and together with the input from a survey answered by more than 100 developers, we show that the model offers a simple, but sound way of obtaining software development estimations with bounded margins of error.},

In this paper, we describe findings that address this paradox based on observation, interviews and quantitative analyses of two open-source projects. The findings suggest that spontaneous work coordinated afterward is effective, rational organizational culture helps achieve agreement among members and communications media moderately support spontaneous work.

Certain aspects of the Open Source development method, e.g., community building, open discussions for requirements and features, and evolvable and modular designs are having fundamental and far reaching consequences on general software engineering practices.To leverage such Open Source methods and tools, we have defined an innovative software engineering paradigm for large corporations: Progressive Open Source (POS). POS leverages the power of Open Source methods and tools for large corporations in a progressive manner: starting from completely within the corporation, to include partner businesses, and eventually complete Open Source. In this paper we present the design goals and principles for POS. We illustrate POS with two programs in HP: Corporate Source and the Collaborative Development Program (CDP). We present early results from both these programs suggesting the power and necessity of POS for all modern large corporations.},

However, the opportunity to add coverage of FOSS varies considerably from institution to institution, and there are always limits to what can be done with existing computing curricula. One approach to solving this limitation is for students to learn about and participate in FOSS projects as an extra-curricular activity. This BoF will provide a forum for faculty members to discuss open source student clubs. The Mozilla Foundation has been developing a program to support open source clubs. The initial clubs were primarily located in Asia, but Mozilla started an effort to expand the clubs to the U.S. during the current academic year. The BoF will include discussion of this effort and materials developed by Mozilla. (See https://opensource.mozilla.community/)},

One factor in this confidence in the security of open source software lies in leveraging large developer communities to find vulnerabilities in the code. Eric Raymond declares Linus' Law "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow." Does Linus' Law hold up ad infinitum? Or, can the multitude of developers become "too many cooks in the kitchen", causing the system's security to suffer as a result? In this study, we examine the security of an open source project in the context of developer collaboration. By analyzing version control logs, we quantified notions of Linus' Law as well as the "too many cooks in the kitchen" viewpoint into developer activity metrics. We performed an empirical case study by examining correlations between the known security vulnerabilities in the open source Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel and developer activity metrics. Files developed by otherwise-independent developer groups were more likely to have a vulnerability, supporting Linus' Law. However, files with changes from nine or more developers were 16 times more likely to have a vulnerability than files changed by fewer than nine developers, indicating that many developers changing code may have a detrimental effect on the system's security.},

abstract = {Researchers are currently drawn to study projects hosted on GitHub due to its popularity, ease of obtaining data, and its distinctive built-in social features. GitHub has been found to create a transparent development environment, which together with a pull request-based workflow, provides a lightweight mechanism for committing, reviewing and managing code changes. These features impact how GitHub is used and the benefits it provides to teams' development and collaboration. While most of the evidence we have is from GitHub's use in open source software (oss) projects, GitHub is also used in an increasing number of commercial projects. It is unknown how GitHub supports these projects given that GitHub's workflow model does not intuitively fit the commercial development way of working. In this paper, we report findings from an online survey and interviews with GitHub users on how GitHub is used for collaboration in commercial projects. We found that many commercial projects adopted practices that are more typical of oss projects including reduced communication, more independent work, and self-organization. We discuss how GitHub's transparency and popular workflow can promote open collaboration, allowing organizations to increase code reuse and promote knowledge sharing across their teams.},

abstract = {One of the key obstacles to pervasive deployment of FPGA accelerators in data centers is their cumbersome programming model. Open source tooling is suggested as a way to develop alternative EDA tools to remedy this issue. Open source FPGA CAD tools have traditionally targeted academic hypothetical architectures, making them impractical for commercial devices. Recently, there have been efforts to develop open source back-end tools targeting commercial devices. These tools claim to follow an alternate data-driven approach that allows them to be more adaptable to the domain requirements such as faster compile time. In this paper, we present RWRoute, the first open source timing-driven router for UltraScale+ devices. RWRoute is built on the RapidWright framework and includes the essential and pragmatic features found in commercial FPGA routers that are often missing from open source tools. Another valuable contribution of this work is an open-source lightweight timing model with high fidelity timing approximations. By leveraging a combination of architectural knowledge, repeating patterns, and extensive analysis of Vivado timing reports, we obtain a slightly pessimistic, lumped delay model within 2\% average accuracy of Vivado for UltraScale+ devices. Compared to Vivado, RWRoute results in a 4.9\texttimes{} compile time improvement at the expense of 10\% Quality of Results (QoR) loss for 665 synthetic and six real designs. A main benefit of our router is enabling fast partial routing at the back-end of a domain-specific flow. Our initial results indicate that more than 9\texttimes{} compile time improvement is achievable for partial routing. The results of this paper show how such a router can be beneficial for a low touch flow to reduce dependency on commercial tools.},

abstract = {Internet search has a strong business model that permits a free service to users, so it is difficult to see why, if at all, there should be open source offerings as well. This paper first discusses open source search, and a rationale for the computer science community at large to get involved. Because there is no shortage of core open source components for at least some of the tasks involved, the Alvis Consortium is building infrastructure for open source search engines using peer-to-peer and subject specific technology as its core, based on this rationale. We view open source search as a rich future playground in which information extraction and retrieval components can be used and intelligent agents can operate.},

abstract = {While research has extensively studied the group of voluntary contributors and their motivation to participate in open source software (OSS) development, we lack an understanding of how firm-sponsored developers behave when they work for an OSS project. In specific, firm-sponsored developers may face identification conflicts arising from different social norms and beliefs inherent in both the organizational culture of their employing company and dominant OSS cultures. These conflicts may induce developer turnover intention towards the organization and the OSS community. This research seeks to identify identification-related determinants that drive turnover intention by surveying Linux kernel developers (N=321). This study finds, among others, that perceived external reputation of the employing organization reduces turnover intention towards the company while perceived own reputation dampens turnover intention directed towards the OSS community.},

abstract = {Open source software (OSS) is probably the best known exemplar of open innovation, with many practitioner-oriented publications having debated the merits and drawbacks of OSS in recent years. Nevertheless, much of the academic research on OSS has focused on individual rather than organizational issues. Hence while there is some understanding of why individual developers and users opt for particular OSS applications, relatively little is known about the adoption of OSS as a software acquisition policy. This paper presents a study of 13 managers in the secondary software sector in Europe, and examines how their perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of OSS affected their decision to adopt an open source policy for software in their companies. The study reveals how their perceptions of the business and technical benefits and drawbacks of OSS influenced the technological, organizational, environmental and individual factors considered within the adoption process. The findings reveal that many of these factors are similar to those reported by previous work on the adoption of innovation, leading us to conclude that organizational processes for the adoption of open innovation are reliant on the practices for closed innovation despite frequently cited loss of organizational control associated with open innovation.},

On this matter, the open-source phenomenon may shed some light, as successful cases on distributed collaboration in the open-source community have been recurrently reported. In this paper, we explore the collaboration networks in the WebKit open-source project, by mining WebKit's source-code version-control-system data with Social Network Analysis (SNA). Our approach allows us to observe how key events in the mobile-device industry have affected the WebKit collaboration network over time. With our findings, we show the explanation power from network visualizations capturing the collaborative dynamics of a high-networked software project over time; and highlight the power of the open-source fork concept as a nexus enabling both features of competition and collaboration. We also reveal the WebKit project as a valuable research site manifesting the novel notion of open-coopetition, where rival firms collaborate with competitors in the open-source community.},

SRBR software development teams have worked in collaboration with Samsung headquarters (HQ), located at South Korea, and Brazilian outsourcing companies (SIDI Institute and other Brazilian partners). Considering the massive volume of software developed by SRBR and partners teams, there naturally has been an enormous use and contribution of open source software. The usage of open source software (OSS) by Samsung and its research centers follows a process to ensure that all use is compliant with OSS licenses. This experience report describes OSKB (Open Source Knowledge Base) tool, a distributed collaboration Web application fully integrated with a tracking issue system, currently used by SRBR teams involved with software development for avoiding duplicated work and improving knowledge sharing among SRBR internal and partners teams. The main reasons behind OSKB development were automating the first step of OSS licenses verification activity reducing duplicated work, serving as a knowledge base of OSS analysis, reducing the time spent in back office operations related with OSS usage and mitigating OSS usage compliance risks.},

abstract = {This paper describes the results of a research study analyzing the challenges of the adoption of open source integrated library systems (OSS ILSs) among U.S. libraries. The research team surveyed 73 libraries of all types currently using proprietary ILSs about their satisfaction with their ILS, whether they have considered migrating to an OSS ILS, and some of the changes that would need to occur inside and outside of the libraries to facilitate migration to OSS ILSs. The results show that most of the libraries surveyed have considered migrating to OSS ILSs. The most common reason for considering migration is the cost savings of OSS ILSs compared to proprietary ILSs. The most common issues libraries cited as reasons not to migrate to OSS ILSs include lack of in-house technical staff and expertise and perceived lack of OSS ILS technical support. This paper contributes to the field by discussing some specific challenges libraries associate with OSS ILSs. This research will help libraries in the OSS ILS community to better address these challenges and encourage OSS ILS adoption.},

Choosing the right components is a critical decision, as it could contribute to the success of any adoption process. Making the right decision requires to evaluate the technical capabilities of the components and also related strategic aspects, including possible impacts on high level objectives. This can be achieved through a portfolio of risk assessment and mitigation methods. In this briefing we introduce the basic concepts related to OSS ecosystems and to risk representation and reasoning. We illustrate how risk management activities in OSS can benefit from the large amount of data available from OSS repositories and how they can be connected to business goals for strategic decision-making. The concepts are illustrated with a software platform developed in the context of the EU FP7 project RISCOSS.},

abstract = {This paper presents an educational model derived from open source methods for computer programming. The article places this search for an alternative model within a framework of proprietary educational practices that are driven by a need for efficiency and rationalization. As an alternative model, the paper suggests that an open source derived educational process would emphasize collaborative problem based learning, working through drafts, risk taking, mentoring, user testing, releasing early and often, developing in collaboration with users, and rewarding and building from failure.At the same time, the paper notes that such a system would have much in common with existing theories of project-based or activity-based learning and with traditional methods of research and publication in scientific endeavors. However, the paper also argues that such a method is different from the open-course or open-curriculum projects recently publicized by several well-known universities as these practices appear to emphasize derived content rather than an open representation of process, or how the content was developed.Collaborative, problem-based learning provides constructive approaches for building corporate and community partnerships on university campuses. At the same time, the model teaches students about collaborative work practices, working as part of a larger community, and the nature of collaborative knowledge building. As such, the model reconnects knowledge creation to research communities and to communities of users and it complicates the belief that sustainable, useful innovation can occur within proprietary systems.},

To capture user innovation and to maintain quality of software and productivity of teams, these projects need to attract and retain contributors. Aim: We want to understand and quantify how inflow and retention are shaped by policies and actions of companies in three application server projects. Method: We identified three hybrid projects implementing the same JavaEE specification and used published literature, online materials, and interviews to quantify actions and policies companies used to get involved. We collected project repository data, analyzed affiliation history of project participants, and used generalized linear models and survival analysis to measure contributor inflow and retention. Results: We identified coherent groups of policies and actions undertaken by sponsoring companies as three models of community involvement and quantified tradeoffs between the inflow and retention each model provides. We found that full control mechanisms and high intensity of commercial involvement were associated with a decrease of external inflow and with improved retention. However, a shared control mechanism was associated with increased external inflow contemporaneously with the increase of commercial involvement. Implications: Inspired by a natural experiment, our methods enabled us to quantify aspects of the balance between community and private interests in open- source software projects and provide clear implications for the structure of future open-source communities.},

abstract = {Configuration errors (i.e., misconfigurations) are among the dominant causes of system failures. Their importance has inspired many research efforts on detecting, diagnosing, and fixing misconfigurations; such research would benefit greatly from a real-world characteristic study on misconfigurations. Unfortunately, few such studies have been conducted in the past, primarily because historical misconfigurations usually have not been recorded rigorously in databases.In this work, we undertake one of the first attempts to conduct a real-world misconfiguration characteristic study. We study a total of 546 real world misconfigurations, including 309 misconfigurations from a commercial storage system deployed at thousands of customers, and 237 from four widely used open source systems (CentOS, MySQL, Apache HTTP Server, and OpenLDAP). Some of our major findings include: (1) A majority of misconfigurations (70.0\%~85.5\%) are due to mistakes in setting configuration parameters; however, a significant number of misconfigurations are due to compatibility issues or component configurations (i.e., not parameter-related). (2) 38.1\%~53.7\% of parameter mistakes are caused by illegal parameters that clearly violate some format or rules, motivating the use of an automatic configuration checker to detect these misconfigurations. (3) A significant percentage (12.2\%~29.7\%) of parameter-based mistakes are due to inconsistencies between different parameter values. (4) 21.7\%~57.3\% of the misconfigurations involve configurations external to the examined system, some even on entirely different hosts. (5) A significant portion of misconfigurations can cause hard-to-diagnose failures, such as crashes, hangs, or severe performance degradation, indicating that systems should be better-equipped to handle misconfigurations.},

abstract = {Who creates the most innovative open-source software projects? And what fate do these projects tend to have? Building on a long history of research to understand innovation in business and other domains, as well as recent advances towards modeling innovation in scientific research from the science of science field, in this paper we adopt the analogy of innovation as emerging from the novel recombination of existing bits of knowledge. As such, we consider as innovative the software projects that recombine existing software libraries in novel ways, i.e., those built on top of atypical combinations of packages as extracted from import statements. We then report on a large-scale quantitative study of innovation in the Python open-source software ecosystem. Our results show that higher levels of innovativeness are statistically associated with higher GitHub star counts, i.e., novelty begets popularity. At the same time, we find that controlling for project size, the more innovative projects tend to involve smaller teams of contributors, as well as be at higher risk of becoming abandoned in the long term. We conclude that innovation and open source sustainability are closely related and, to some extent, antagonistic.},

abstract = {Commercial software project managers design project organizational structure carefully, mindful of available skills, division of labour, geographical boundaries, etc. These organizational "cathedrals" are to be contrasted with the "bazaar-like" nature of Open Source Software (OSS) Projects, which have no pre-designed organizational structure. Any structure that exists is dynamic, self-organizing, latent, and usually not explicitly stated. Still, in large, complex, successful, OSS projects, we do expect that subcommunities will form spontaneously within the developer teams. Studying these subcommunities, and their behavior can shed light on how successful OSS projects self-organize. This phenomenon could well hold important lessons for how commercial software teams might be organized. Building on known well-established techniques for detecting community structure in complex networks, we extract and study latent subcommunities from the email social network of several projects: Apache HTTPD, Python, PostgresSQL, Perl, and Apache ANT. We then validate them with software development activity history. Our results show that subcommunities do indeed spontaneously arise within these projects as the projects evolve. These subcommunities manifest most strongly in technical discussions, and are significantly connected with collaboration behaviour.},

abstract = {Commonly, the design flow of integrated circuits from initial specifications to fabrication employs commercial, proprietary EDA tools. While these tools deliver high-quality, production-ready results, they can be seen as expensive black boxes and thus, are not suited for research and academic purposes. Innovations on the field are mostly focused on optimizing the quality of the results of the designs by modifying core elements of the tool chain or using techniques of the Machine Learning domain. In both cases, researchers require many or long runs of EDA tools for comparing results or generating training data for Machine Learning models. Using proprietary, commercial tools in those cases may be either not affordable or not possible at all.With OpenROAD and OpenLane mature open-source alternatives emerged in the past couple of years. The development is driven by a growing community that is improving and extending the tools daily. In contrast to commercial tools, OpenROAD and OpenLane are transparent and allow inspection, modification and replacement of every tool aspect. They are also free and therefore are well suited for use cases such as Machine Learning data generation. Specifically, the fact that no licenses are needed neither for the tools nor for the default PDK enables even fresh students and starters on the field to quickly deploy their ideas and create initial proof of concepts.Therefore, we at Infineon are using OpenROAD and OpenLane for more experimental and innovative projects. Our vision is to build initial prototypes using free software, and then improve upon them by cross-checking and polishing with commercial tools before delivering them for production. This talk will show Infineon's experience with these open-source tools so far.The first steps involved getting OpenLane installed in our company IT infrastructure. While their developers offer convenient build methods using Docker containers, these cannot be used in Infineon's compute farm. This, and also the fact that most of the open-source tools are currently evolving quickly with little to no versioning, lead to the setup of an in-house continuous integration and continuous delivery system for nightly and weekly builds of the tools. Once the necessary tools were installed and running, effort was put into integrating Infineon's in-house technology data.At Infineon, we envision two use cases for OpenROAD/OpenLane: physical synthesis hyperparameter exploration (and tuning) and optimization of the complete flow starting from RTL. First, our goal is to use OpenROAD's AutoTuner in the path-finding phase to automatically and cost-effectively find optimal parameters for the flow and then build upon these results within a commercial tool for the later steps near the tapeout. Second, we want to include not only the synthesis flow inside the optimization loop of the AutoTuner, but also our in-house RTL generation framework (MetaRTL). For instance, having RTL generators for a RISC-V CPU and also the results of simulated runtime benchmarks for each iteration, the AutoTuner should be able to change fundamental aspects (for example number of pipeline stages) of the RTL to reach certain power, performance, and area requirements when running the benchmark code on the CPU.Overall, we see OpenROAD/OpenLane as a viable alternative to commercial tools, especially for research and academic use, where modifications to the tools are needed and where very long and otherwise costly tool runtimes are expected.},

abstract = {In an era of software crisis, the move of firms towards distributed software development teams is being challenged by emerging collaboration issues. On this matter, the open-source phenomenon may shed some light, as successful cases on distributed collaboration in the open-source community have been recurrently reported. In our research we explore collaboration networks in the WebKit and OpenStack open-source projects, by mining their source-code version-control-systems data with Social Network Analysis (SNA). Our approach allows us to observe how key events in the industry affect open-source collaboration networks over time. With our findings, we highlight the explanation power from network visualizations capturing the collaborative dynamics of high-networked software projects over time. Moreover, we depicted that competing companies that market similar products in the same market, can collaborate in the open-source community while publicly manifesting intense rivalry (e.g. Apple vs Samsung patent-wars). After integrating our findings with the current body of theoretical knowledge in management strategy, economics, strategic alliances and coopetition, we propose the novel notion of open-coopetition, where rival firms collaborate with competitors in the open-source community. We argue that classical coopetition management theories do not fully explain the competitive and collaborative issues that are simultaneously present and interconnected in the WebKit and OpenStack open-source communities. We propose the development of the novel open-coopetition theory for a better understanding on how rival-firms collaborate with competitors in an open-source fashion.},

abstract = {In spite of the hype and hysteria surrounding open source software development, there is very little that can be said of open source in general. Open source projects range in scope from the miniscule, such as the thousands of non-maintained code dumps left behind at the end of class projects, dissertations, and failed commercial ventures, to the truly international, with thousands of developers collaborating, directly or indirectly, on a common platform. One characteristic that is shared by the largest and most successful open source projects, however, is a software architecture designed to promote anarchic collaboration through extensions while at the same time preserving centralized control over the interfaces.This talk features a survey of the state-of-the-practice in open source development in regards to software architecture, with particular emphasis on the modular extensibility interfaces within several of the most successful projects, including Apache httpd, Eclipse, Mozilla Firefox, Linux kernel, and the World Wide Web (which few people recognize as an open source project in itself). These projects fall under the general category of collaborative open source software development, which emphasizes community aspects of software engineering in order to compensate for the often-volunteer nature of core developers and take advantage of the scalability obtainable through Internet-based virtual organizations.},

The primary objective is to facilitate data analysis by offering a machine learning studio equipped with pre-built algorithms. Remarkably, this platform eliminates the need for coding, allowing users to effortlessly generate AI models. Furthermore [19], it provides a secure environment for sharing these models without compromising data privacy---a noteworthy contribution in the realm of federated learning (FL).The platform's significance lies in its ability to empower nontechnical users to perform advanced tasks without requiring specialized expertise.},

abstract = {Engaging students in humanitarian free and open source software (HFOSS) projects allows them to gain real-world software development skills while helping society. Participating in an existing HFOSS project, although ripe with learning opportunities, presents a number of hurdles for faculty and students. An alternative to joining an existing HFOSS project community is to participate in a faculty-led HFOSS project. These projects provide the instructor with more control over the learning environment, but often lack an active community outside of the classroom. This paper describes a multi-institutional effort to engage a community of developers in creating humanitarian open source projects to support their on-campus food pantries. Food insecurity on campus has become a national concern and many institutions have, or are starting, food pantries to support the student, staff, and faculty community. Starting a faculty-led HFOSS project involves making decisions not only about the features of the project but also about community norms, tool choices, project development workflow, and inter-institution cooperation. This paper provides an overview of the creation of LibreFoodPantry, a community who is developing a suite of projects that support on-campus food pantries. It describes instances of using LibreFoodPantry's projects in various classroom settings, the lessons learned from these experiences, and the resulting discussions and decisions made by the LibreFoodPantry Coordinating Committee. This process has led to a community dedicated to easing the on-ramp for faculty who want to help their students contribute to an HFOSS project.},

abstract = {Open-source software has integrated itself into our daily lives, impacting 78\% of US companies in 2015 [11]. Past studies of open-source community dynamics have found motivations behind contributions [3, 14, 18, 19] and the significance of community engagement [8, 17], but there are still many aspects not well understood. There's a direct correlation between the success of an open-source project and the social interactions within its community [7, 9, 17]. Most projects depend on a small group. A study by Avelino et al. [4] on the 133 most popular GitHub projects found that 86\% will fail if one or two of its core contributors leave. To sustain open-source, we need to better understand how contributors interact, what information is shared, and what concerns practitioners have. We study common topics, how these have changed over time (2011 - 2021), and what social issues have appeared within open-source communities. Our research is guided by the following questions: (1) How is open-source changing/evolving? (2) What changes do practitioners believe are necessary for open-source to be sustainable?},

abstract = {It is becoming commonplace for companies to contribute to open source software (OSS) projects. At the same time, many software organizations are applying Scrum software development practices, for productivity and quality gains. Scrum calls for self-organizing teams, in which the development team has total control over its development process. However, OSS projects typically have their own processes and standards, which might not mesh well with a company's internal processes, such as Scrum. This paper presents an experience report from Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), where the "toolchain CPU compiler" team directly participates in the "LLVM" OSS project. The team ran into a number of difficulties when using Scrum to manage their development. In particular, the team often failed to complete Scrum sprints where tasks required interaction with the open source community. We look at how the team redefined task flows to alleviate these difficulties, and eventually evolved a highly modified process, dubbed TWINS (This Workflow Is Not Scrum). We assess the revised process, and compare it to other established agile methods, finding it bears a strong resemblance to Scrumban (the SIE team was not aware of Scrumban previously). The TWINS framework presented here may help other organizations who develop software in-house and engage in OSS projects, to gain the best of both worlds.},

abstract = {As computer science educators, many of us share the common challenge of assessing students' programming skills. While a number of commercial services have popped up to fill this need, numerous members of the CS-Education community develop and maintain their own in-house tools. Commercial services may increase the costs to institutions and students, while instructor-developed tools are usually tailored to their own use cases; as a result, new instructors often, in turn, build their own highly-specialized solutions. This BOF is intended to spark a conversation about how we as a community can address this challenge by working together. In particular, we will discuss the availability of current open source tools and how they can be generalized, with a focus on editors, compilers, questionnaires, and scoring systems for assessments, including web-based and local-software solutions. Looking forward, we will discuss possible avenues to unite platforms and code bases, coordinate, and collaborate in the future-including student involvement as part of their coursework (e.g., capstone projects) to further develop platforms. Finally, by providing a dedicated session, we hope to advertise and disseminate the open source availability of these projects for those who seek a low- or no-cost solution for their students.},

Despite the high frequency of use of open source licenses, there has been little work about whether software developers understand the open source licenses they use. To our knowledge, only one survey has been conducted, which focused on which licenses developers choose and when they encounter problems with licensing open source software. To help fill the gap of whether or not developers understand the open source licenses they use, we conducted a survey that posed development scenarios involving three popular open source licenses (GNU GPL 3.0, GNU LGPL 3.0 and MPL 2.0) both alone and in combination. The 375 respondents to the survey, who were largely developers, gave answers consistent with those of a legal expert's opinion in 62\% of 42 cases. Although developers clearly understood cases involving one license, they struggled when multiple licenses were involved. An analysis of the quantitative and qualitative results of the study indicate a need for tool support to help guide developers in understanding this critical information attached to software components.},

In order to understand how the the population of contributors evolve over time, we propose a methodology that adapts Lotka-Volterra-based biological models used for describing host-parasite interactions. Experiments based on data from the Github collaborative platform showed that the proposed approach performs effectively in terms of providing an estimation of the population of developers for each project over time.},

abstract = {Recently, many faculty have begun to engage students in free and open source software (FOSS) development both for pedagogical advantage and in response to increased student demand. Faculty see FOSS as providing authentic computing artifacts to enrich course content. Students see FOSS projects as a way to contribute to something real and develop their skills while building a portfolio of their work to share with potential employers. Despite these benefits, CS teachers and students have expressed frustration with the challenges of engaging with existing FOSS projects.This BOF will provide a forum for faculty and members of FOSS communities to exchange ideas and methods for engaging students in FOSS, including what did and did not work. The kinds of questions that often arise include whether to let students choose their own projects or select projects for them, and whether to establish mentoring relationships with the project community in advance, or to let students develop these relationships for themselves. Other questions often heard are whether to let students form their own work groups, assign the groups, or if students may work by themselves on a project. Conversely, there are FOSS projects that have questions on how to best engage qualified students. Participant input collected initially will be used to prioritize among the questions above.},

abstract = {Open Source license is a prerequisite for open source software, which regulates the use, modification, redistribution, and attribution of the software. Open source license is crucial to the community development and commercial interests of an OSS project, yet choosing a proper license from hundreds of licenses remains challenging. Tools assisting developers to understand the terms and pick the right license have been emerging, while inferring license compatibility on the dependency tree and satisfying the complex needs of developers are beyond the capability of most of them. Thus we propose LicenseRec, an open source license recommendation tool that helps to bridge the gap. LicenseRec performs fine-grained license compatibility checks on OSS projects' code and dependencies, and assists developers to choose the optimal license through an interactive wizard with guidelines of three aspects: personal open source style, business pattern, and community development. The usefulness of LicenseRec is confirmed by the consistent positive feedback from 10 software developers with academic and industrial backgrounds. Our tool is accessible at https://licenserec.com and a video showcasing the tool is available at https://video.licenserec.com.},

a self-extending evolutionary technology driven by the needs of its
participants to share information. Traditionally, the Internet, and

In this paper, we present the integration of the open source speech recognition, natural language processing, and dialogue management components into a robot software platform, and also report on a preliminary experiment of the integrated system using real users. Gesturing of the robot, which is also important in human-robot interaction, is combined with the spoken content of the robot utterance and included in the dialogue management component. As the dialogue domain we chose mealtime discussions on food and recipes, since spoken communication with a companion robot in such scenarios is considered natural and useful.},

Open source software projects are becoming increasingly more popular. Many major companies have started building open source software. Unfortunately, many newcomers only commit once to an open source project before moving on to another project. Even worse, many novices struggle with joining open source communities and end up leaving quickly, sometimes before their first successful contribution. In this paper, we propose a conversational bot that would recommend projects to newcomers and assist in the onboarding to the open source community. The bot would be able to provide helpful resources, such as Stack Overflow related content. It would also be able to recommend human mentors. We believe that this bot would improve newcomers' experience by providing support not only during their first contribution, but by acting as an agent to engage them to the project.},

However, there are occasions when open source software packages or projects primarily governed by copyright licenses come into potential conflict with patent issues, or suffer from other governance concerns regarding third-party Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). From an economic perspective it is interesting how instead of undermining adoption, such challenges have led to an increase of collaborative governance solutions in open source, perhaps inspired by how such collaboration in development and business matters has provided benefit to stakeholders. In this paper, we show this evolution of collaborative solutions in open source business by actual example, and in the process illustrate how this unique approach to dealing with diverse ownership across business sectors works in practice.},

abstract = {Unlike in commercial software development, open source software (OSS) projects do not generally have managers with direct control over how developers spend their time, yet for projects with large, diverse sets of contributors, the need exists to focus and steer development in a particular direction in a coordinated way. This is especially important for "infrastructure" projects, such as critical libraries and programming languages that many other people depend on. Some projects have taken the approach of borrowing planning tools that originated in commercial development, despite the fact that these techniques were designed for very different contexts, e.g. strong top-down control and profit motives. Little research has been done to understand how these practices are adapted to a new context. In this paper, we examine the Rust project's use of roadmaps: how has an important OSS infrastructure project adapted an inherently top-down tool to the freewheeling world of OSS? We find that because Rust's roadmaps are built in part by summarizing what motivated developers most prefer to work on, they are in some ways more a description of the motivated labor available than they are a directive that the community move in a particular direction. They allow the community to avoid wasting time on unpopular proposals by revealing that there will be little help in building them, and encouraging work on popular features by making visible the amount of consensus in those features. Roadmaps generate a collective focus without limiting the full scope of what developers work on: roadmap issues consume proportionally more effort than other issues, but constitute a minority of the work done (i.e issues and pull requests made) by both central and peripheral participants. They also create transparency among and beyond the community into what central contributors' plans are, and allow more rational decision-making by providing a way for evidence about community needs to be linked to decision-making.},

abstract = {At Colorado State University, the engineering computing labs were running up huge printing costs due to excessive printing. We looked into several commercial print quota solutions that were quite pricey and limited in capability. We wanted something cheap (who doesn't?) and available across several computing platforms. The open source option we settled on consists of a print daemon (LPRng), Samba, a custom accounting script written in Perl, MySQL, Sendmail, and the print filter IFHP. In addition to our command-line administration utilities, we've developed a web-based administration system that uses Apache and PHP as a scripting language. The web-based system greatly simplifies our administration needs. Our system currently runs on the Linux platform, but could conceivably run on any Unix or Unix-like flavor. Our conglomeration of code bases satisfies all our requirements, and we have realized a large decrease in costs, as well as an associated increase in intelligent printing practices on the part of users. In this paper, we will outline the components of the PQuota system, how they interact, and their role in fulfilling our objectives of cost effectiveness, cross platform availability and ease of use for both administrators and users as well as low user impact.},

abstract = {In an era of software crisis, the move of firms towards distributed software development teams is being challenged by emerging collaboration issues. On this matter, the open-source phenomenon may shed some light, as successful cases on distributed collaboration in the open-source community have been recurrently reported. In our research we explore collaboration networks in the WebKit and OpenStack high-networked open-source projects, by mining their source-code version-control-systems data with Social Network Analysis (SNA). Our approach allows us to observe how key events in the industry affect open-source collaboration networks over time. With our findings, we highlight the explanatory power from network visualizations capturing the collaborative dynamics of high-networked software projects over time. Moreover, we argue that competing companies that sell similar products in the same market, can collaborate in the open-source community while publicly manifesting intense rivalry (e.g. Apple vs Samsung patent-wars). After integrating our findings with the current body of theoretical knowledge in management strategy, economics, strategic alliances and coopetition, we propose the novel notion of open-coopetition, where rival firms collaborate with competitors in the open-source community. We argue that classical coopetition management theories do not fully explain the competitive and collaborative issues that are simultaneously present and interconnected in the WebKit and OpenStack open-source communities. We propose the development of the novel open-coopetition theory for a better understanding on how rival-firms collaborate with competitors by open-source manners.},

Short presentations and lectures interlaced with a great deal of hands-on activities is the preferred method of learning for many career oriented undergraduates. More so, students that are currently working in the IT field would like to learn skills that they can immediately apply to their work environment. Many students often ask about remote access and VPNs as a relevant need for companies in which they hold entry level IT positions. Students learn how to provide basic and advanced security for a small to medium size company to include firewall, intrusion detection and prevention, proxing, VPNs and implementing security policies. Some of the students have configured IPCop firewalls for small business in the Burlington area as a result of this class. Professor Balan teaches students how to setup profitable consulting business in network administration and information security field by using Open Source products. Professor Balan will be joined by some of his students in this presentation. The students will help participants get an IPCop firewall up and running and connected to the classroom network. Additionally, the participants will setup site-to-site and "road-warrior" VPNs. Professor Balan will discuss classroom techniques for teaching using hands-on activities and how to prompt students to ask pertinent questions about topics that lead to meaningful discussions and presentation on security topics.

abstract = {Concept Inventory (CI) assessments, which target high-level learning goals, have proven highly valuable for higher education research. These assessments have helped to evaluate pedagogical practices among individual instructors, both within and across institutions, and have hence elevated the level of discourse on education within the community. The success of CIs in physics has inspired similar developments in computer science, with a few CIs now developed for computer science courses. However, the development of a CI typically follows a burdensome process, requiring a significant investment to produce a single CI that may be difficult to deploy due to institutional curricular differences. Furthermore, as our field continues to be shaped by technological advances, a path to faster, more modular CI development is critical.This paper proposes an alternative CI development model and continues the discussion within the community about the need for, and path to, concept inventories throughout the computer science curriculum. Specifically, we explore the implications of an open collaboration system for CI development that would mimic the principles common to open source software communities, which have regularly demonstrated their ability to produce high-quality results.},

abstract = {All-flash storage (AFS) systems have become an essential infrastructure component to support enterprise applications, where sub-millisecond latency and very high throughput are required. Nevertheless, the price per capacity ofsolid-state drives (SSDs) is relatively high, which has encouraged system architects to adoptdata reduction techniques, mainlydeduplication andcompression, in enterprise storage solutions. To provide higher reliability and performance, SSDs are typically grouped usingredundant array of independent disk (RAID) configurations. Data reduction on top of RAID arrays, however, adds I/O overheads and also complicates the I/O patterns redirected to the underlying backend SSDs, which invalidates the best-practice configurations used in AFS. Unfortunately, existing works on the performance of data reduction do not consider its interaction and I/O overheads with other enterprise storage components including SSD arrays and RAID controllers. In this paper, using a real setup with enterprise-grade components and based on the open-source data reduction module RedHat VDO, we reveal novel observations on the performance gap between the state-of-the-art and the optimal all-flash storage stack with integrated data reduction. We therefore explore the I/O patterns at the storage entry point and compare them with those at the disk subsystem. Our analysis shows a significant amount of I/O overheads for guaranteeing consistency and avoiding data loss through data journaling, frequent small-sized metadata updates, and duplicate content verification. We accompany these observations with cross-layer optimizations to enhance the performance of AFS, which range from deriving new optimal hardware RAID configurations up to introducing changes to the enterprise storage stack. By analyzing the characteristics of I/O types and their overheads, we propose three techniques: (a) application-aware lazy persistence, (b) a fast, read-only I/O cache for duplicate verification, and (c) disaggregation of block maps and data by offloading block maps to a very fast persistent memory device. By consolidating all proposed optimizations and implementing them in an enterprise AFS, we show 1.3\texttimes{} to 12.5\texttimes{} speedup over the baseline AFS with 90\% data reduction, and from 7.8\texttimes{} up to 57\texttimes{} performance/cost improvement over an optimized AFS (with no data reduction) running applications ranging from 100\% read-only to 100\% write-only accesses.},

Their commonality and variability are discussed. An approach is developed that establishes the mapping from a particular release (major or minor) to the specific earliest and latest revisions, i.e., a commit window of a release, in the source control repository. For example, the major release 25.0 in Chrome is mapped to the earliest revision 157687 and latest revision 165096 in the trunk. This mapping between releases and commits would facilitate a systematic choice of history in units of the project evolution scale (i.e., commits that constitute a software release).

As the importance of open source continues to grow, companies also expect to grow thriving and sustainable open source communities with continued contributions and better collaborations. In this study, we applied the contribution leaderboard to seven open source projects initiated by Alibaba. We conducted a case study to investigate the perceptions and facts regarding how to motivate collaboration through gamification. Specifically, we employed a social network algorithm, OpenRank, to evaluate and steer developers' contributions. We validated the effectiveness of OpenRank by comparing it with other evaluation metrics and surveying developers. Through semi-structured interviews and project metric analysis, we found that the OpenRank Leaderboard can promote transparent communication environments, a better community atmosphere, and improved collaboration behavior.},

Questions that interest us include: Does taking a course in security help students be more aware of the risks and vulnerabilities in their web browsing practices? When presented with a security warning, do they make the right decision? We present our results in designing and applying a survey on web security at a large university. We have released our survey instrument to the public domain and are in the process of getting other institutions to help refine the questions. We envision the following advantages of open-sourcing surveys: questions can be re-used at different institutions, results can be compared between institutions, and a world-wide community can collaborate and improve the quality of the survey instrument over time.},

This problem is rooted on the fact that the contents generated by these companies are not usually adequately recorded, managed, and exploited, and thus negatively affecting the organization and their competitiveness levels. Now, although most of this issue may be solved through enterprise content management (ECM) solutions, they are not affordable for most SMEs because of their high prices. Within this context, this study proposes the implementation of a cloud-based open-source ECM model at a manufacturing SME in Peru. Through this model, the company was able to access the benefits of an ECM to restructure the way they manage content, gaining 67\% more efficiency, establishing a collaboration channel between employees, suppliers, and customers, and reporting a 93\% model adaptation rate among staff members.},

The success of various OSS projects, such as Linux and Apache, is now widely recognized. Many organizations have shown interest not only in using OSS, but also in applying the underlying collaborative practices within their internal software development activities; this phenomenon is known as Inner Source. By combining best practices of OSS development from the current Inner Source literature, we develop a new model that allows us to rate an organization's maturity level regarding the adoption of Inner Source. By testing our model within a medical diagnostics corporation, we present various insights on Inner Source efforts and how Inner Source can improve software development.},

Many institutions face budget restrictions that make it difficult to use proprietary software. Instructors at such institutions are naturally turning to open source, freeware, and shareware resources for use in their courses. In addition to being attractive from a monetary standpoint, open source software offers several advantages over proprietary software. Often a large community of developers has contributed to the software, which can result in a particularly robust and reliable product. Even more importantly, students can download the software to personal PCs for use in the course or further exploration.This tutorial will provide an overview of nifty open source, freeware, and shareware software that we have successfully used in a variety of Web programming courses with net-centric components.},

With government funding, the community organization contracted with a small software firm to design and implement participatively a web-based ‘community portal’ using open source software and techniques. While adopting these progressive development ideals has brought notable benefits, they have also posed significant challenges for the parties involved. In particular, mis-matched expectations, budget squeezes, and slipped schedules have been attributed to the approach being too participatory and too open. We examine these claims and offer insights into community-oriented, participatory, open source development projects.},

In addition to the traditional multiple-choice and short answer questions that have been augmented with the extensive randomization and customization routines of WeBWorK, this new environment (called WeBWorK-JAG where JAG stands for Java Auto Grader) can automatically collect and grade free-form program fragments written in Java. Novel pedagogy has been developed based on the capabilities of this extension and preliminary classroom results are discussed in this paper. For example, when students contributed to WeBWorK by creating WeBWorK-JAG questions for their peers, they are exposed to the reality of creating comprehensive unit tests and to the wider quality assurance aspects of formulating questions and their solution sets. This work is described in the context of an emerging commercial market for web-based programming assistants and its unique contributions are summarized.},

Popularity of cloud based on-demand infrastructure (SaaS) has simplified the process of obtaining the hosting platforms for the developers. As a result, the demand for qualified administrators of Unix-like systems is growing rapidly. Education of Unix-like system administrators is a complicated and uncertain task due to diversity and large amount of different Unix-like platforms. The vendors of commercial distributions offer training courses and certifications. However, a significant number of open source distributions are remaining uncovered by structured and defined training routines. Considering these facts, we organized an open e-course relying on Debian Linux. In this paper, we will share our experience of the course development and teaching. Our main contributions are a scalable, secured and automatic task verification system; and a supplementary infrastructure solution that allows performing the course tasks at any location with internet access. Powering the course with these two developed components resulted in improvement of time resource and course quality. In addition, we will describe our developed solution in detail and analyze qualitative feedback of the students gathered during three years of teaching.},

abstract = {Context: In recent years, many research studies have shown how human factors play a significant role in the quality of software components. Code authorship metrics have been introduced to establish a chain of responsibility and simplify management when assigning tasks in large and distributed software development teams. Researchers have investigated the relationship between code authorship metrics and fault occurrences in software systems. However, we have observed that these studies have only been carried on large software systems having hundreds to thousands of contributors. In our preliminary investigations on Android applications that are considered to be relatively small, we observed that applications systems are not totally owned by a single developer (as one could expect) and that cases of no clear authorship also exist like in large systems. To this end, we do believe that the Android applications could face the same challenges faced by large software systems and could also benefit from such studies.Goal: We investigate the extent to which the findings obtained on large software systems applies to Android applications. Approach: Building on the designs of previous studies, we analyze 278 Android applications carefully selected from GitHub. We extract code authorship metrics from the applications and examine the relationship between code authorship metrics and faults using statistical modeling.Results: Our analyses confirm most of the previous findings, i.e., Android applications with higher levels of code authorship among contributors experience fewer faults.},

abstract = {The economy of FLOSS (Free and open source software) has been the subject of numerous studies and publications, particularly on the issue of business models. However, there are fewer studies on the local networks of FLOSS providers. This research focuses on the ecosystem of Belgian FLOSS providers and, more specifically, their geographical distribution, the activities, technologies and software they support, their business models, their economic performance and the relationships between companies. The research is based on a directory containing nearly 150 companies. This directory led to the creation of a specialized search engine that helped to improve annotation. The research also uses financial data provided by the Belgian Central Balance Sheet Office. The initial results of this study show a concentration in major economic areas. The businesses are more active in the services and are heavily involved activities such as infrastructure software and Web development, activities which were common in the early years of free software development. Services for the support of business software is also common. A first analysis of the graph of relationships between providers' websites highlights the role that is played by the multinational IT companies, by FLOSS editors, by commercial FLOSS associations and especially by the Walloon centers of competence that offer vast training catalogs that are dedicated to FLOSS. This research opens up many perspectives for improving the automation of the company directory updates, the analysis of the relationship between enterprises, and the automation of the financial analysis of companies.},

abstract = {Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has come to play a critical role in the global software industry. Organizations are widely adopting FOSS and interacting with open source communities, and hence organizations have a considerable interest in seeing these communities flourishing. Little research has focused on the tools used to develop that software. Given the absence of formal mandate that would appear in traditional organizations, an open question is what influences a FOSS contributor's decision to adopt a tool and how workflows get established in FOSS teams. In this paper we report on a Delphi study conducted in the Debian Project, one of the largest FOSS projects. Drawing from data collected in three phases from a panel of 21 carefully selected and well-informed participants, we identified 15 factors that affect decisions to adopt tools and relate those to existing models of innovation and diffusion.},

One interesting practice is that of diagramming. Though well studied and important in many aspects of co-located software development (including communication and collaboration among developers), its role in OSS development has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we report our investigation on how and why Ubuntu contributors use diagrams in their work. Our study shows that diagrams are not actively used in many scenarios where they commonly would in co-located software development efforts. We describe differences in the use and practices of diagramming, their possible reasons, and present design considerations for potential systems aimed at better supporting diagram use in OSS development.},

The lack of flexibility, high cost of developing and maintaining DES models, the high volume of data that these need in order to provide valid results and the difficulty in embedding them in real time problems, are some of the problems that deter organizations from adopting DES based solutions. DREAM is an FP7 project with the aim to develop an Open Source (OS) platform, which will confront the above issues. The DREAM architecture consists of three cloud enabled modules, a semantic free Simulation Engine (SE), a Knowledge Extraction (KE) tool and a customizable web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI).

abstract = {While the cloud computing becomes popular in the industry and companies take advantages of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) as well as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions, education is sometimes one step behind. SaaS cloud solutions are commonly used in education since they provide well-established services like email, instant messaging, shared calendar. But IaaS and PaaS are rarely taken into account while legacy hosting services are still popular with students and lecturers of computer science. Majority of these users will actually not benefit from IaaS as they simply want to run their own or existing applications. This survey tries to answer the question which open-source PaaS solutions should be taken into account for demonstrations and practice in courses focused on web applications. Suitable PaaS platform can also be deployed at the university's IT infrastructure and used to host projects of students, researchers and lecturers. Google App Engine, OpenShift, Cloud Foundry and Heroku platforms are being investigated and their features and pricing are being discussed in the context of use in education. This article summarizes supported languages and services, porting-related issues and platforms' restrictions, pricing (focusing on low-cost plans) and private cloud installation options and complexity. The results show that there are differences that make some of the platforms more suitable, particularly because of different associated costs and different complexity of porting existing applications to the cloud.},

This paper describes an Open Source robotic framework to standardize the use of motion capture systems called MOCAP4ROS2. This framework features a layered architecture that allows building applications that use Motion Capture systems regardless of the specific system model/vendor. The challenges are technical and social: on the one hand, resolving synchronization and representation issues; on the other hand, involving the community to reach a consensus on the necessary interfaces. MOCAP4ROS2 has been implemented in ROS2 and already has drivers (we understand a driver for MOCA4ROS2 as a ROS2 node that publish the MOCAP system information) for today’s main commercial systems.},

abstract = {Recommender systems constitute a new field that provides nowadays an important support for information search from huge amounts of data, since some of those information may be of interest of users but hard to be searched manually. According to forecasts, data production tends to grow more and more, which places recommender systems on the way to play a key role in mining those data. Technologies about to be adopted in large scale require tools to enable their mass production, and this fact is the key motivation of this work. In this paper we present our research in the field of component-based software engineering to design a framework for recommender systems. We have elicited the requirements that all recommender systems might address, and developed a vertical framework to support the development of such a sort of systems by designing components in accordance with those requirements. With the Idealize Recommendation Framework, we intend to make the development of recommender systems an easier, faster, and standardized process, as well as to perform the foundation of the technical terms to be used in the area.},

abstract = {The Panama Papers network maintained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) represents a large set of relationships between people, companies, and organizations involved in the creation of offshore companies in tax-haven territories, mainly for hiding their assets. The Panama Papers network includes people or companies that had affairs with the Panamanian offshore law firm Mossack Fonseca, often with the purpose of laundering money. In our previous work, we proposed a ranking algorithm, namely the Suspiciousness Rank Back and Forth (SRBF) algorithm, that, given the Panama Papers network, leverages a blacklist of known bad entities to assign a degree of suspiciousness to each entity in the network. This algorithm proved to be efficient in detecting known bad entities in the Panama Papers, but we were not able to verify the accuracy of the produced entity ranking for non-blacklisted entities.In this paper, we propose to use the open-source intelligence (OSINT) methodology as a modern derivative of classical ethnographic and archaeological research methods that help us in validating with external open source data the ranking result of the Suspiciousness Rank Back and Forth algorithm. More specifically, we conduct a parallel, but independent, investigation using OSINT to assess the claims of SRBF algorithm. We identify positive outcomes from this study, describe current gaps in our process, and propose solutions to the gaps in order to better integrate the OSINT methodology with the SRBF ranking approach.},

abstract = {A common criticism of undergraduate computer science is a disconnect from software development in the real world. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduced an actively developed open-source software project into a third-year software engineering course. We selected a humanitarian software project, Ushahidi, a crisis-mapping web application that is deployed worldwide to track events as diverse as election violence in developing countries, natural disasters and recently, Hurricane Sandy.The primary learning outcome of working with open-source software is that communication skills are as important as programming skills when developing software on a large scale. Working with an active open-source project exposed students to interesting issues related to real-world software development and facilitated direct interaction with expert, professional developers. Positive experiences included successfully understanding, modifying and debugging software written by someone else -- a rare activity in most curricula. The students also had to work with Ushahidi's distributed development model, common to many open-source projects, which reinforced the importance of communication skills and associated tools. Students also experienced some negative realities such as non-existent or outdated documentation and inconsistent software interfaces.Aside from the technical learning outcomes, an intangible benefit of our approach was the motivation students experienced from having someone other than their instructor interested in their progress. As well, the use of a humanitarian software project exposed students to the changing face of computing from its business and scientific roots into new application areas.},

Analyzing consolidated summer of code programs can reveal how college students, who these programs usually target, can be motivated to participate in OSS, and what onboarding strategies OSS communities adopt to receive these students. In this paper, we study the well-established Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and devise an integrated engagement theory grounded in multiple data sources to explain motivation and onboarding in this context. Our analysis shows that OSS communities employ several strategies for planning and executing student participation, socially integrating the students, and rewarding student’s contributions and achievements. Students are motivated by a blend of rewards, which are moderated by external factors. We presented these rewards and the motivation theory to students who had never participated in a summer of code program and collected their shift in motivation after learning about the theory. New students can benefit from the former students' experiences detailed in our results, and OSS stakeholders can leverage both the insight into students’ motivations for joining such programs as well as the onboarding strategies we identify to devise actions to attract and retain newcomers.},

As an innovative contribution, this paper proposes a collective intelligence (CI) approach for improving the free software adoption by small and medium-sized municipalities. To build this CI-approach, the authors have analyzed the dynamic of the communities hosted by Brazilian Public Software (BPS) Portal and the actions related to implementation of software solution in Brazilian municipalities. They started by identifying key variables and their relationship, and mining data from the communities whose software solutions have been successfully implemented in the municipalities according to player reports available in BPS portal. Such as the relationships demonstrate, these players have been appropriated the knowledge related to solutions and created new business to support the modernization of public administration. Based on reports and statistical analysis, the authors could understand both the dynamic of the successful communities and the adoption phenomena by municipalities as a consequence of individual initiatives. The results indicate that a CI-approach based on 5W1H can improve the knowledge sharing and promote the best practice in the free software adoption by small and medium-sized municipalities.},

Combining a longitudinal single case study to more than 46 interviews with open source community members (editors and contributors), we were able to identify key managerial changes that impact community activity and highlight how certain strategic parameters of the project determine the community composition and its health. In this study, by health we qualify a wide range of aspects going from the dynamisms of external contributions to the valuation of contributors, contributions and dissemination to end users. We firstly show that managerial decisions are as important as technical choices regarding the software health. Some purely managerial decisions regarding governance structures for example can impact the community willingness to contribute and therefore the available resources to develop the software. Secondly, we put forward the importance of having a coopetitive community (i.e. community with several competing firms) to stimulate and attract valuable users and contributors that highly participate to the software health according to our interviewees.},

However, commercial devices complicate and limit the collection of raw and real-time data, suffer from privacy issues and are not tailored to using them with VR tracking systems. We address these issues with an open source design to facilitate the construction of VR-enabled wearables for conducting scientific experiments. Our work is motivated by research in mixed realities in pervasive computing environments. We introduce our system and present a proof-of-concept study with 17 participants. Our results show that the wearable reliably measures high-quality data comparable to commercially available fitness trackers and that it does not impede movements or interfere with VR tracking.},

abstract = {For years, many academic researchers in reconfigurable computing have been frustrated by their reliance on commercial FPGAs and tools. Commercial FPGAs have highly complex micro-architectures, come with undocumented binary interfaces, have no compatibility between generations, and come with difficult to use proprietary place and route tools. The FPGA vendors are making the right moves for serving their commercial customer base, but it seems at times these moves are in conflict with the needs of the academic research community.These problems make it difficult for academics to teach FPGA design and to participate in relevant research related to FPGAs. Complex FPGA fabrics and undocumented proprietary interfaces make it nearly impossible to build new tools to target actual commercial devices. University researchers are now hesitant to participate in FPGA architecture research because the level of complexity of FPGAs is beyond what is possible to implement in an academic setting. Reconfigurable computing application developers are at the mercy of complex FPGA devices and closed-source place and route tools - not optimized for computing applications.Some argue that the time is right for academia to break away and create an open source FPGA device. Such an effort would enable university researchers to take an active role in architecture design, and promote an open source community effort in developing and advancing the state of the art of tools.A similar situation existed in the early 80's surrounding processor design. As a result of competition among the big computer companies, microprocessor designs had evolved from very simple beginnings to highly complex architectures and equally complex compilers. Universities were largely on the sidelines, as they couldn't compete at the level of industrial designs of the day. "RISC" changed all that. By adopting simple architectures, universities were once again able to actually design and implement their own processors and to innovate with microarchitecture and compilers.Is it time for a "RISC" revolution for FPGAs? FPGA companies might argue that FPGA platforms are necessarily complex and out of the realm of what's possible to implement within an academic setting, and would say that an open source effort in not necessary, as they are helping to promote academic research by collaborations with universities, and donation of tools, and hardware platforms.This panel will discuss the pros and cons of an academic community led open FPGA device and tools development effort.},

This is a problem, because open source is becoming increasingly popular and more knowledge is necessary for companies on how to capitalize on this phenomenon. Objectives. With this paper, insight is developed into the relation between software ecosystem health and financial performance of the open source company that nurtures it. Method. A case study on two open source companies, Cloudera and Hortonworks, is performed. The software ecosystem health and financial performance of both companies are assessed. Results. Cloudera is healthier in terms of robustness and niche creation, while Hortonworks is healthier in terms of productivity. Financially, Cloudera performs better than Hortonworks. Conclusion. The following hypotheses are formulated. Software ecosystem health has an expected positive relation with financial performance. Niche creation health is the main contributor to this relation, robustness health is a minor reason for this relation, and software ecosystem productivity health has little to no influence.},

Faculty at smaller colleges and universities face significant challenges in finding meaningful research projects. Some of the difficulties may include a shortage of graduate students, a lack of hardware and software resources, and limited funding. An innovative applied research project in flight simulation at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga involved the development of a virtual reality Space Shuttle landing simulation to help educate elementary and middle school students about space flight. This project addressed the above concerns by involving undergraduate as well as master's students in the project, by tapping private foundation funding, and by using off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software as a basis for the project. By adopting this approach we were able to develop an interesting and technically challenging project with benefits for the simulation users as well as the faculty and students involved, thus taking advantage of a type of educational opportunity which might not otherwise be available at a small institution.},

abstract = {To support the cultivation of open source processor chip design talents and to provide a high-quality talent development and assessment model for universities to assess students of the "Computing System and Processor" course and for enterprises to recruit graduates, professionals from enterprises and teachers from universities have collaborated to design an open source processor chip design talent competency model based on the CC2020 competency model, science and engineering practice theory and curriculum theory, in order to provide relatively reasonable, comprehensive and accurate reference information for talent training and education teaching. This poster designed a competency model that includes statement, computing and professional knowledge-skills pairs and dispositions. The summary results of the visual assessment tool designed on the basis of the competency model are presented, including an initial description of student characteristics, a comprehensive task-based assessment conclusion, as well as a detailed analysis of the dimensions of computing and professional knowledge-skill pairs and dispositions and corresponding suggestions. The authors will continue to refine the quantification of student learning behavior markers to provide easy-to-operate reference data for education and teaching and to enhance the usability of the model.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need in bandwidth requirements, particularly, due to the increase in the device resolution [1]. As a result, there is a strong demand to decrease the video transmission bitrate without reducing visual quality. In 2010, a Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) was established by ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and ISO/IEC Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) to work on the video coding standard, which was called the High-Efficiency Video Coding standard, or HEVC in short. The H.265/MPEG-HEVC video coding standard [2] was approved in 2013 (see Figure 1), and it provides approximately 50\% coding gain compared to its predecessor H.264/MPEG-AVC [3],[4].The x265 encoder [5]-[7] is a popular open-source encoder, which generates bitstreams compliant with the HEVC video coding standard. Built on top of x264 [8], the x265 encoder is integrated into several popular open-source frameworks, such as ffmpeg [9], GStreamer [10], and HandBrake [11]. x265 is used by a variety of broadcast and streaming service providers who leverage benefits of HEVC for streaming live and over-the-top (OTT) content. In addition to implementing nearly all the tools defined in HEVC, it implements many algorithmic optimizations that enable trading off encoder performance for quality [5]-[7]. Additionally, performance-critical kernels are implemented with hand-coded assembly kernels that use AVX2 and AVX-512 single instruction, multiple data instructions to improve performance on x86 CPUs. This flexible architecture of x265 makes it a popular choice for HEVC encoding for both on-premises and on the cloud services. In addition, recent x265 development efforts have been focused on a further coding gain increase. Particularly, there is a continuous need to extract key information automatically from videos for the purpose of indexing and scene analysis, and also in order to improve coding efficiency of the video encoders. To support this vision, reliable scene change detection algorithms must be developed.In this work, we present a novel algorithm for the gradual and abrupt scene change detection by using picture histograms, variance and pixel intensity. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can be used to detect scene change with a high reliability and with the reduced computational complexity. According to the proposed approach, the novel scenecut algorithm detects scene changes in a video and decides on how aggressively each I-frame has to to be placed within the video. For that, each picture/frame is divided into a number of regions. Histograms and pixel intensities are considered for these regions separately, such that the higher is a number of regions, the higher the reliability of the algorithm is. During this work, it was decided to fix the number of regions to the value of nine to optimize the above-mentioned scenarios. Figure 2 below presents a flow chart of the proposed novel scene change detection algorithm.Note that the intensity contrast characterizes the intensity difference between an object and background. Both variance and intensity contrast are used for thresholding, which is obtained by computing their weighted sum. Further, a sliding window of three adjacent frames is employed to determine whether there is an abrupt scenecut or there is a gradual transition, while a decision of the number of frames within the sliding window is compromised due to the reliability and delay (i.e. if more frames are considered, then the reliability improves, but the delay increases as well).The conducted extensive experimental results show significant bit-rate savings in terms of BD-BR [12] as well as computational complexity reduction in terms of encoded frames per second.},

abstract = {With millions of apps available to users, the mobile app market is rapidly becoming very crowded. Given the intense competition, the time to market is a critical factor for the success and profitability of an app. In order to shorten the development cycle, developers often focus their efforts on the unique features and workflows of their apps and rely on third-party Open Source Software (OSS) for the common features. Unfortunately, despite their benefits, careless use of OSS can introduce significant legal and security risks, which if ignored can not only jeopardize security and privacy of end users, but can also cause app developers high financial loss. However, tracking OSS components, their versions, and interdependencies can be very tedious and error-prone, particularly if an OSS is imported with little to no knowledge of its provenance.We therefore propose OSSPolice, a scalable and fully-automated tool for mobile app developers to quickly analyze their apps and identify free software license violations as well as usage of known vulnerable versions of OSS. OSSPolice introduces a novel hierarchical indexing scheme to achieve both high scalability and accuracy, and is capable of efficiently comparing similarities of app binaries against a database of hundreds of thousands of OSS sources (billions of lines of code). We populated OSSPolice with 60K C/C++ and 77K Java OSS sources and analyzed 1.6M free Google Play Store apps. Our results show that 1) over 40K apps potentially violate GPL/AGPL licensing terms, and 2) over 100K of apps use known vulnerable versions of OSS. Further analysis shows that developers violate GPL/AGPL licensing terms due to lack of alternatives, and use vulnerable versions of OSS despite efforts from companies like Google to improve app security. OSSPolice is available on GitHub.},

In this paper, we aim at mining IoRT software architectural evidence from open source IoRT software repositories. For this, we (i) extract a dataset from GitHub repositories containing real open-source IoRT systems, (ii) mine relevant information from those repositories, (iii) and compile a catalog of architectural software characteristics. The catalog from our study can then be used by practitioners architects.},

abstract = {Open source software communities are a significant site of AI development, but “Ethical AI” discourses largely focus on the problems that arise in software produced by private companies. Design, policy and tooling interventions to encourage “Ethical AI” based on studies in private companies risk being ill-suited for an open source context, which operates under radically different organizational structures, cultural norms, and incentives. In this paper, we show that significant and understudied harms and possibilities originate from differing practices of transparency and accountability in the open source community. We conducted an interview study of an AI-enabled open source Deepfake project to understand how members of that community reason about the ethics of their work. We found that notions of the “Freedom 0” to use code without any restriction, alongside beliefs about technology neutrality and technological inevitability, were central to how community members framed their responsibilities, and the actions they believed were and were not available to them. We propose a continuum between harms resulting from how a system is implemented versus how it is used, and show how commitments to radical transparency in open source allow great ethical scrutiny for harms wrought by implementation bugs, but allow harms through (mis)use to proliferate, requiring a deeper toolbox for disincentivizing harmful use. We discuss how an assumption of control over downstream uses is often implicit in discourses of “Ethical AI”, but outline alternative possibilities for action in cases such as open source where this assumption may not hold.},

abstract = {It is now commonplace for organizations to pay developers to work on specific open source software (OSS) projects to pursue their business goals. Such paid developers work alongside voluntary contributors, but given the different motivations of these two groups of developers, conflict may arise, which may pose a threat to a project's sustainability. This paper presents an empirical study of paid developers and volunteers in Rust, a popular open source programming language project. Rust is a particularly interesting case given considerable concerns about corporate participation. We compare volunteers and paid developers through contribution characteristics and long-term participation, and solicit volunteers' perceptions on paid developers. We find that core paid developers tend to contribute more frequently; commits contributed by onetime paid developers have bigger sizes; peripheral paid developers implement more features; and being paid plays a positive role in becoming a long-term contributor. We also find that volunteers do have some prejudices against paid developers. This study suggests that the dichotomous view of paid vs. volunteer developers is too simplistic and that further subgroups can be identified. Companies should become more sensitive to how they engage with OSS communities, in certain ways as suggested by this study.},

abstract = {Large-scale paper-based examinations (PBEs) in computing education frequently emphasize rote memorization, thereby misaligning instructional objectives with assessment techniques. Such incongruities hinder the preparation of students for real world challenges in both industry and academia by inadequately evaluating higher-order cognitive abilities. Often, educators are deterred from implementing comprehensive skills assessment due to the perceived complexity and resource-intensive grading processes involved. To mitigate these limitations, this paper introduces an exam mode as an integral feature of the open-source learning platform Artemis. Designed for both local and cloud-based deployment, this exam mode incorporates anti-cheating protocols, automates the grading of diverse exercise types, and features double-blind manual grading to ensure assessment integrity. It fosters the evaluation of complex cognitive skills while substantially reducing the administrative load on faculty. This paper substantiates the effectiveness of the Artemis&nbsp; exam mode through widespread institutional adoption, demonstrated by over 50 successful computer-based examinations (CBEs). An in-depth case study involving 1,700 undergraduate software engineering students offers key insights, best practices, and lessons learned. This research not only pioneers the documentation of a secure, scalable, and reliable exam system at an institutional scale but also marks a seminal contribution to modernizing assessment strategies in computing education, with a particular focus on constructive alignment.},

abstract = {Computer access is increasingly critical for all aspects of life from education to employment to daily living, health and almost all types of participation. The pandemic has highlighted our dependence on technology, but the dependence existed before and is continuing after. Yet many face barriers due to disability, literacy, or digital literacy. Although the problems faced by individuals with disabilities have received focus for some time, the problems faced by people who just have difficulty in using technologies has not, but is a second large, yet less understood problem. Solutions exist but are often not installed, buried, hard to find, and difficult to understand and use. To address these problems, an open-source extension to the Windows and macOS operating systems has been under exploration and development by an international consortium of organizations, companies, and individuals. It combines auto-personalization, layering, and enhanced discovery, with the ability to Install on Demand (IoD) any assistive technologies a user needs. The software, called Morphic, is now installed on all of the computers across campus at several major universities and libraries in the US and Canada. It makes computers simpler to use, and allows whichever features or assistive technologies a person needs to appear on any computer they encounter (that has Morphic on it) and want to use at school, work, library, community center, etc. This demonstration will cover both the basic and advanced features as well as how to get free copies of the open-source software and configure it for school, work or personal use. It will also highlight lessons learned from the placements.},

abstract = {In the past few years, substantial research has been conducted to find out the anomalies present in the real-world business processes. Existing research either uses process mining techniques or discrete sequence-based anomaly detection techniques. The bug-fixing process of various open-source projects has been analyzed previously to discover the process inefficiencies using process mining techniques. These works exploit generic process mining tools to create the process models. Also, they did not evaluate the performance of their proposed conformance checking algorithms. In addition to these, the discrete sequence-based analogy and anomaly detection techniques are not discussed in the bug-fixing process context. In this paper, we report a bug-fixing process dataset for 30 Apache open-source projects that use JIRA bug tracking system for bug reporting. This real-world dataset is analyzed to discover the anomalous process sequences and the root cause of anomalies. The contributions of this paper include (i) a formalized approach for pre-processing and transforming the bug report history data, from bug tracking systems into event logs, suitable for process analysis; (ii) a process mining based anomaly detection framework for bug-fixing processes that comprises our proposed algorithms for process discovery and conformance checking; and (iii) an artificial labelled process dataset available at Mendeley open-source dataset repository ( doi:10.17632/5yb2xv93w3.1).},

abstract = {Open source software has drawn more and more attention from researchers, developers and companies nowadays. Meanwhile, many Chinese technology companies are embracing open source and choosing to open source their projects. Nevertheless, most previous studies are concentrated on international companies such as Microsoft or Google, while the practical values of open source projects of Chinese technology companies remain unclear. To address this issue, we conduct a mixed-method study to investigate the landscape of projects open sourced by three large Chinese technology companies, namely Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent (BAT). We study the categories and characteristics of open source projects, the developer's perceptions towards open sourcing effort for these companies, and the internationalization effort of their open source projects. We collected 1,000 open source projects that were open sourced by BAT in GitHub and performed an online survey that received 101 responses from developers of these projects. Some key findings include: 1) BAT prefer to open source frontend development projects, 2) 88\% of the respondents are positive towards open sourcing software projects in their respective companies, 3) 64\% of the respondents reveal that the most common motivations for BAT to open source their projects are the desire to gain fame, expand their influence and gain recruitment advantage, 4) respondents believe that the most common internationalization effort is "providing an English version of readme files", 5) projects with more internationalization effort (i.e., include an English readme file) are more popular. Our findings provide directions for software engineering researchers and provide practical suggestions to software developers and Chinese technology companies.},

abstract = {The teaching of programming skills to young students is often described by those educators involved as problematic at best. Student issues like mathematical maturity, readiness for complex thought, basic problem solving skills, short attention span especially related to the boredom of traditional programming teaching methodologies, and the lack of exciting problems and their solutions with respect to programming assignments contribute to the angst of many a programming instructor. A small fraction of students who "were just made for programming" always seem to succeed at whatever programming problem is given to them. However, a majority of students, especially precollege and college freshmen tend to have difficulty in overcoming these issues. It is with that observation that something new, in terms of programming pedagogy, needed to be investigated by this paper's authors.An ideal opportunity requiring successful programming instruction for 7-12 graders in the local metropolitan area presented itself in the winter of 2012. The students were involved in a statewide competition where groups of students self-selected into project options offered by various sponsoring institutions.Under the "Technology" choice heading of the state program, the student team and the instructor agreed to program a microprocessor to send messages in International Morse Code. The object of the exercise was to learn basic programming skills and to apply them to solving a problem. The hook was to do something brand new the students had never engaged in, keeping their attention on the end goal, and to see the immediate real-time results of some programming effort along the development cycle as the completed final program took form.The effort was a resounding success; the students learned in a few Saturday morning sessions more about programming than the authors have experienced over weeks of effort in traditional programming classes at the college freshman level.},

abstract = {Most research regarding innovation in free and open source software (FOSS) pertains to identifying supporting conditions for promoting code contribution. This raises concerns about the ability of FOSS communities to remain innovative based only on the perspectives of developer-users. Preliminary research suggests different open source business models may provide motivation to support greater involvement of non-developer users. This research focuses on understanding the relationship between business model and supporting participation architectures, beyond users' code contributions, to enable user participation in design of the software.},

abstract = {As eye tracking in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) becomes established, it will be used by broader demographics, increasing the likelihood of tracking errors. Therefore, it is important when designing eye tracking applications or interaction techniques to test them at different signal quality levels to ensure they function for as many people as possible. We present GE-Simulator, a novel open-source Unity toolkit that allows the simulation of accuracy, precision, and data loss errors during real-time usage by adding gaze vector errors into the gaze vector from the head-mounted AR/VR eye tracker. The tool is customisable without having to change the source code and changes in eye tracking errors during and in-between usage. Our toolkit allows designers to prototype new applications at different levels of eye tracking in the early phases of design and can be used to evaluate techniques with users at varying signal quality levels.},

abstract = {Earables research is a promising field in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) due to the variety of observable phenomena that can be captured by sensors placed in the ear region. However, this field is hindered by the use of custom-built hardware and software, which can create barriers for less experienced researchers and lead to high assessment heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we have developed a platform for electrophysiological ear-centered research. This platform combines the established amplifier hardware and recording software stack of the OpenBCI biosignal ExG system with a low-cost 3D-printed over-ear headphone design, based on electrode positioning best practices from neuroscientific research. To demonstrate the flexibility and potential of this platform, we have conducted two studies replicating classical EEG, EOG, ECG, and EMG patterns, and showing that the system is reliable and easy to use in a promising application scenario: detecting mental workload levels across multiple tasks.},

abstract = {In recent years, privacy and data rights have garnered growing attention in public discourse, policy making, and scholarly research. New data protection laws are being rolled out globally to codify data rights and ensure individual control over how personal data is shared and used. This evolving landscape presents several opportunities and challenges for healthcare. In this case study, we outline a design research agenda that emerged from the practical needs of an open source community focused on digital health software for community health in low- and middle-income countries. We situate this case study in the global landscape of data regulations, and the call for responsible data practices that go above and beyond regulatory compliance. We share findings from the formative stages of our multi-stage design process, which include a scoping literature review and a reframing of institutional policies and procedures. A primary contribution of our case study is that it offers an example of the institutional ‘pre-work’ necessary to make sense of the complex data protection landscape, and to chart a path forward for designing software that better supports responsible data practices. This case study also articulates the important role for digital health designers and implementers in operationalizing patient data rights.},

abstract = {Video applications continue to gain a lot of traction and have an enormous demand. As a result, there is a strong demand to decrease the video transmission bitrate without reducing visual quality [1],[2]. The efforts to achieve bitrate savings, especially for high-definition video content started in 2010, when the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) and ISO/IEC Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) established a Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) to work on the High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. Then, in 2013, the 1st version of the HEVC specification was approved by ITU-T as Recommendation H.265 and by ISO/IEC as MPEG-H, Part 2 [3]. When developing the H.265/MPEG-HEVC standard, high-resolution and high frame-rate video coding was considered as one of its main potential application scenarios, while keeping it applicable to almost all existing use cases that were already targeted by H.264/MPEG-AVC.However, more efficient video compression techniques were still desired, especially for streaming Ultra HD video content as well as Panorama video content (so called, 360° video content) from concerts, shows, sport events, etc. Therefore, in order to fulfill this demand, the exploration phase for future video coding technologies beyond HEVC (ITU-T H.265 | ISO/IEC 23008-2) started in October 2015 by establishing a Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET) on Future Video Coding of ITU-T VCEG and ISO/IEC MPEG [4]. The development process of the video coding standard beyond HEVC was driven by the most recent scientific and technological achievements in the video coding field, and under the JVET development it was titled "Versatile Video Coding" [5], or in short, VVC [6]. The 1st version of the VVC standard (i.e. VVC v1) was officially finalized during the 19th JVET meeting, which took place between June 22 and July 1, 2020, and it was approved by ITU-T as Recommendation H.266 and by ISO/IEC as MPEG-I, Part 3 [6].While the joint video coding standardization activities of ITU-T and ISO/IEC organizations rely on an open and collaborative process driven by its active members, several companies individually developed their own video coding formats [7], [8]. Such in 2015, the Alliance for Open Media(AOM) was formed with the objective to work towards next-generation media formats in general and with a particular short-term focus on the development of a video-coding scheme [9],[10],[11]. In April 2016, AOM released a baseline version of the developed video-coding scheme, which got the name of AV1. In turn, the final version of the 1st edition of AV1 released in 2018, claiming to provide a significant coding-efficiency gain over the current state-of-the-art video codecs [10]. In May 2020, AV1 codec had a major update and its 2nd edition, i.e. AV1 2.0, was released [12],[13]. In turn, AV1 3.0 with better compression performance was released in 2021 [12],[13]. However, experimental results related to coding efficiency comparison of AV1 versus standardized codecs such as HEVC and VVC, which are reported in the literature [14], are not consistent and are sometimes even contradictory. As a result, there is a lot of confusion about the ability of future versions of AV1 to compete with HEVC/VVC-based encoder implementations.In order to put things into perspective and to provide relevant information in a reproducible and reliable form, this work presents detailed experimental results of a coding-efficiency comparison of AV1 (aomenc) v3.6 [12] versus VVC-based codecs -the open-source VVenC codec v1.7 [15] and VVC reference software model (VTM) v17.0, and versus HEVC-based codecs - the open-source x265 codec v3.5 [16],[17] and HEVC reference software model (HM) v17.0 [18], along with a detailed discussion of the selected software implementations, the choice of coding parameters, and the corresponding evaluation setup. All tested encoders have been set to the best quality operation modes (i.e. the slowest encoding options) with a Group of Pictures (GOP) size equal to 16. Specifically, in this work, the authors focus on 4K and 1080p video content (selected from JVET CTC [19]), since it is considered to be the most popular nowadays, especially within the consumer multimedia applications, and encoding such content is typically the most challenging due to significantly larger computational complexity in terms of encoding times compared to lower video resolutions. For the rate-distortion (R-D) performance assessment, the authors used a Bj\o{}ntegaard-Delta bit-rate (BD-BR) measurement method for calculating average bit-rate differences between R-D curves for the same objective quality (e.g., for the same PSNRYUV) [20].According to the experimental results, the coding efficiency of both AV1 and x265 was found to be significantly inferior to VVenC, while having the overhead of 31.2\% and 118\%, respectively. In terms of the encoding speed, the typical encoding time of AV1 is ~5 times slower than HM, and ~2 times slower than VVenC. On the other hand, the encoding time of x265 for the given best quality mode configuration is similar to that of HM, while HM provides bitrate savings of more than 22\%. When compared to VTM, the HM runtime is more than 12 times faster, but with an overhead of ~52\%.},

abstract = {Axiom has been in development since 1971. Originally called Scratchpad II, it was developed by IBM under the direction of Richard Jenks[1]. The project evolved over a period of 20 years as a research platform for developing new ideas in computational mathematics. ScratchPad also attracked the interest and contributions of a large number of mathematicians and computer scientists outside of IBM. In the 1990s, the Scratchpad project was renamed to Axiom, and sold to the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) in England who marketed it as a commercial system. NAG withdrew Axiom from the market in October 2001 and agreed to release Axiom as free software, under an open source license.Tim Daly (a former ScratchPad developer at IBM) setup a pubic open source Axiom project[2] in October 2002 with a primary goal to improve the documentation of Axiom through the extensive use of literate programming[3]. The first free open source version of Axiom was released in 2003. Since that time the project has attracted a small but very active group of developers and a growing number of users.This exhibit includes a laptop computer running a recent version of Axiom, Internet access (if available) to the Axiom Wiki website[4], and CDs containing Axiom software for free distribution[5].},

A unified research model is developed by drawing on established theories from organizational and sociological literature, in particular by combining Self-Determination-Theory (SDT) and Social-Identity-Theory (SIT). Both SDT and SIT have been found valuable concepts for staffing decisions in organizations.

abstract = {Dynamic translation is a general purpose tool used for instrumenting programs at run time. Performance of translated execution relies on balancing the cost of translation against the benefits of any optimizations achieved, and many current translators perform substantial rewriting during translation in an attempt to reduce execution time. Our results show that these optimizations offer no significant benefit even when the translated program has a small, hot working set. When used in a broader range of applications, such as ubiquitous policy enforcement or penetration detection, translator performance cannot rely on the presence of a hot working set to amortize the cost of translation. A simpler, more maintainable, adaptable, and smaller translator appears preferable to more complicated designs in most cases.HDTrans is a light-weight dynamic instrumentation system for the IA-32 architecture that uses some simple and effective translation techniques in combination with established trace linearization and code caching optimizations. We present an evaluation of translation overhead under both benchmark and less idealized conditions, showing that conventional benchmarks do not provide a good prediction of translation overhead when used pervasively.A further contribution of this paper is an analysis of the effectiveness of post-link static pre-translation techniques for overhead reduction. Our results indicate that static pre-translation is effective only when expensive instrumentation or optimization is performed.},

However, most solutions are based on systems which are closed, rigid and dependent on proprietary keypad or platform. We have developed OpenIRS-UCM, a free teaching tool for interactive polling that solves these drawbacks. It is an open source software so it allows the development of new functions by anybody. It has a friendly interface that anyone without high computer skills can use. It enables the coexistence of several commercial clickers simultaneously with smart-phones, tablets or other modern electronic devices. It is developed in Java, thus its use is not restricted to systems based on Microsoft Windows and it is independent of any proprietary software.The excellent acceptance of this teaching tool at University Complutense of Madrid has encouraged the creation of a repository that holds all the source code and executables files, in order to facilitate its widespread use.},

abstract = {The success of an open-source project depends to a large degree on the proactive and constructive participation by the developer community. An important role that developers play in a project is that of a code committer. However, code-commit privilege is typically restricted to the core group of a project. In this paper, we study the phenomenon of the induction of external developers as code committers. The trustworthiness of an external developer is one of the key factors that determines the granting of commit privileges. Therefore, we formulate different hypotheses to explain how the trust is established in practice. To investigate our hypotheses, we developed an automated approach based on mining code repositories and bug-tracking systems. We implemented the approach and performed an empirical study, using the Eclipse projects, to test the hypotheses. Our results indicate that, most frequently, developers establish trust and credibility in a project by contributing to the project in a non-committer role. Moreover, the employing organization of a developer is another factor--although a less significant one--that influences trust.},

abstract = {Company engagement in open source (OSS) is now the new norm. From large technology companies to startups, companies are participating in the OSS ecosystem by open-sourcing their technology, sponsoring projects through funding or paid developer time. However, our understanding of the OSS ecosystem is rooted in the "old world" model where individual contributors sustain OSS projects. In this work, we create a more comprehensive understanding of the hybrid OSS landscape by investigating what motivates companies to contribute and how they contribute to OSS. We conducted interviews with 20 participants who have different roles (e.g., CEO, OSPO Lead, Ecosystem Strategist) at 17 different companies of different sizes from large companies (e.g. Microsoft, RedHat, Google, Spotify) to startups. Data from semi-structured interviews reveal that company motivations can be categorized into four levels (Founders' Vision, Reputation, Business Advantage, and Reciprocity) and companies participate through different mechanisms (e.g., Developers' Time, Mentoring Time, Advocacy \&amp; Promotion Time), each of which tie to the different types of motivations. We hope our findings nudge more companies to participate in the OSS ecosystem, helping make it robust, diverse, and sustainable.},

However, there is limited research on examining levels of geographic and organizational distribution within open source software projects, despite many studies examining these same aspects in commercial contexts. We set out to fill this gap in OSS knowledge by manually collecting data for two large, mature, successful projects in an effort to assess how distributed they are, both geographically and organizationally. Both Firefox and Eclipse have been the subject of many studies and are ubiquitous in the areas of software development and internet usage respectively. We identified the top contributors that made 95\% of the changes over multiple major releases of Firefox and Eclipse and determined their geographic locations and organizational affiliations. We examine the distribution in each project's constituent subsystems and report the relationship of pre- and post-release defects with distribution levels.},

This paper outlines specific issues faced by those who conduct requirements analysis in the context of open source projects in which the user communities are widely distributed. The examples described are drawn from the experience of managing tool development within the Sakai Project [1], a higher education effort to build and share a community source framework for supporting on-line collaboration in academic courses and projects. With a far-flung community of users and developers, this project requires new approaches to eliciting, analyzing, and prioritizing user needs. The issues outlined in this paper are currently being met by a preliminary set of solutions that makes use of web-based project management technologies. These technologies along with some planning and communication strategies help improve the decision-making process involved in deciding whether and how to choose among proposed constraints, use cases, and feature requests.},

Depending on the voluntary commitment of their contributors, initiatives developing Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) identified members' learning and their retention as vital. Although contributors' knowledge building has been repeatedly found to facilitate their project continuance, FLOSS projects are lacking operational advices on how to assist their members' learning. Drawing on previous literature which emphasizes project members' social interactions and their practical experiences to build new knowledge, we propose mentoring as a training method for FLOSS projects. Based on organizational experiences, we propose a measure to evaluate mentoring as an appropriate strategy for FLOSS initiatives to facilitate individuals' learning and to retain their contributors on longitudinal base.},

abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has rapidly gained traction as a viable method for optimizing control in real-time video streaming. Recent research endeavors are shifting towards enabling direct DRL control over multiple streaming parameters, moving away from traditional bitrate only control. Despite this growing interest, there is a notable absence of a dedicated open-source framework to facilitate such research.In response, we introduce Pandia, a specialized open-source framework designed for the direct manipulation of multiple realtime video streaming parameters using DRL. Pandia effectively bridges advanced DRL frameworks like OnRL and SB3 with the WebRTC, a leading real-time video streaming platform. Our initial use case with Pandia showcases its capability in advancing DRL application in WebRTC control. Our study identifies significant training challenges in basic network settings, mainly due to negative impacts from random exploration. To counter this, we adopt a curriculum learning approach, using domain knowledge for more effective, guided exploration. Both the training methodology outlined in our use case and the Pandia framework are poised to contribute to ongoing research in DRL's application to WebRTC control.},

abstract = {Accessibility software for motor impairment permits individuals who cannot access electronic devices through traditional input hardware to control desktop computers, tablets or smart phones despite moderate or severe dysfunction of motor control. Due to the relatively small size of the severely motor impaired community and the large fixed costs of developing accessibility software, commercial accessibility software solutions are often relatively expensive, with price ranges between 500-10,000 USD, which renders them unaffordable for a sizable proportion of the motor impaired population. Furthermore, due to the modest potential for profit of the accessibility software market, certain technologically feasible accessibility software solutions are often not even developed by commercial companies. Until recently, open source accessibility software solutions have been relatively scarce and the existing ones do not cover the entire range of available commercial software solutions. In this work, we present an initiative created by scholars at Otago Polytechnic to address this mismatch. We have leveraged capstone projects of our Information Technology degree program to guide students towards the creation of a range of open source accessibility software solutions that are made widely available through an online repository. Thereby, motor impaired users with limited financial means can use our software for free to interact with computers. The open source nature of our projects makes it possible for computationally skilled software developers to extend our software solutions by adding new features or improving existing functionality. We present here the first applications created by our initiative and the corresponding online repository where we make them available to address the needs of the financially constrained motor impaired community.},

Work practices used by companies to contribute to five established OSS projects are investigated through examination of the actions of employees in public communication channels and draw on our experiences when analysing engagement with the same projects. We find that companies utilise work practices for contributing which are congruent with the circumstances and their capabilities that support their short and long term needs. We find that companies contribute to OSS projects in different ways, such as employing core project developers, making donations, and joining project steering committees in order to advance strategic interests.},

abstract = {The Internet and the World Wide Web have become integral parts of the lives of many modern individuals, enabling almost instantaneous communication, sharing and broadcasting of thoughts, feelings and opinions. Much of this information is publicly facing, and as such, it can be utilised in a multitude of online investigations, ranging from employee vetting and credit checking to counter-terrorism and fraud prevention/detection. However, the search needs and behaviours of these investigators are not well documented in the literature. In order to address this gap, an in-depth qualitative study was carried out in cooperation with a leading investigation company. The research contribution is an initial identification of Open-Source Intelligence investigator search behaviours, the procedures and practices that they undertake, along with an overview of the difficulties and challenges that they encounter as part of their domain. This lays the foundation for future research in to the varied domain of Open-Source Intelligence gathering.},

abstract = {Organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) are drawing increasing attention due to their unique advantages of mechanical flexibility, low-cost fabrication, and biodegradability, enabling diverse applications that were not achievable using traditional inorganic transistors. With a growing number of complex applications being proposed, the need for expediting the design process and ensuring the yield of large-scale designs with organic technology increases. A complete digital standard cell library plays a crucial role in integrating the emerging organic technology into existing computer-aided-design (CAD) flows.In this paper, we present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a standard cell library based on bottom gate, top contact pentacene OTFTs. We also propose a commercial tool compatible, RTL-to-GDS flow along with a new organic process design kit (PDK) developed based on our process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source organic standard cell library, enabling the community to explore this emerging technology.},

abstract = {Because of the increasing acceptance and possibly expanding market of free/libre open source software (FLOSS), the spectrum and scale of companies that participate in FLOSS development have substantially expanded in recent years. Companies get involved in FLOSS projects to acquire user innovations [3, 12], to reduce costs [8, 11], to make money on complementary services [13], etc. Such intense involvement may change the nature of FLOSS development and pose critical challenges for the sustainability of the projects. For example, it has been found that a company's full control and intense involvement is associated with a decrease of volunteer inflow [13]. Sometimes a project may fail after one company pulls resources from the project [13]. This raises concerns about the domination of one company in a project. In large projects like OpenStack, there are often hundreds of companies involved in contributing code. Despite substantial researches on commercial participation, whether or not one company dominates a project and the impact of such domination has never been explicitly explored. We investigate four main projects of OpenStack, a large ecosystem that has had a tremendous impact on computing and society, to answer the following research questions: Does one company dominate the project's development (RQ1)? If the answer to RQ1 is yes, does the domination affect the community (RQ2)?},

abstract = {Since the 80's, education (training, education and training per se) in the legislative context meant the employee training standards and rules arising from the specific laws of "home" legislation. Analogous to the process of structural changes in economy and politics in the late 80's, Brazil also promoted the modernization of their legislative houses. Through funding from the Interamerican Development Bank, it was possible to promote the program InterLegis. The objective of this program was the modernization and integration of the Legislature in its federal, state and municipal levels and promoting greater transparency and interaction with society that Power. Soon became apparent that the model open, collaborative and open management of knowledge and information InterLegis was an innovative model, but above all, there were still limits and challenges to the Legislature and can education and development of officials and parliamentarians of the Legislative Houses. This article will seek to identify the limits and challenges of improving this innovative model of using free software and web-based collaborative environment and information and communication technologies. Methodologically this article is structured from a previous exploratory research, checking conditions and models of InterLegis, besides the participation of the authors within the mailing lists and use of information packets and applications available on the web environment of the program. It was performed an exploratory research the topic of collaborative scientific production, electronic government and electronic governance and the use of free software by government, where they found several articles and texts. As a further step was made a theoretical framework on these themes that helped formulate the analysis of the limits and challenges of the open model, collaborative and open management of knowledge and information InterLegis.},

In this paper, we analyze the most common reasons, sentiment polarity, and interaction length for pull request rejections, as well as the correlations between these factors in a large open-source project called Scapy. We manually analyzed 231 rejected pull requests and systematically mapped sentiment and categorized rejection reasons. We found that the most frequent reasons for pull request rejection refer to source code management issues, incomplete comprehension of project functionalities, poor understanding of what reviewers expect, and misunderstanding the project guidelines (often due to a lack of complete/updated instructions and communication gaps). This work is an ongoing effort toward establishing practical guidelines for globally distributed contributors in open-source projects to minimize pull request rejection and maximize productivity leading to more fruitful remote collaboration. Future work involves expanding the analysis to more projects and incorporating quantitative methods.},

abstract = {As an answer to the disabled community’s odyssey to gain access to adaptable, modular, multilingual, cheap and sustainable Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) products, we propose the use of the ITHACA framework. It is a software environment for building component-based AAC applications, grounded on the Design for All principles and a hybrid---community and commercial---Open Source development model. ITHACA addresses the developers, the vendors, as well as the people who use AAC. We introduce a new viewpoint on the AAC product design-develop-distribute lifecycle, and a novel way to search-select-modify-maintain the AAC aid. ITHACA provides programmers with a set of tools and reusable Open Source code for building AAC software components. It also facilitates AAC product vendors to put together sophisticated applications using the available on the Web, independently premanufactured, free or commercial software parts. Furthermore, it provides people who use AAC with a variety of compatible AAC software products which incorporate multimodal, user-tailored interfaces that can fulfill their changing needs. The ITHACA architecture and the proposed fusion of past and current approaches, trends and technologies are explained. ITHACA has been successfully applied by implementing a family of AAC products, based on interchangeable components. Several ready to use ITHACA-based components, including on-screen keyboards, Text-to-Speech, symbol selection sets, e-chatting, emailing, and scanning-based input, as well as four complete communication aids addressing different user cases have been developed. This demonstration showed good acceptance of the ITHACA applications and substantial improvement of the end users’ communication skills. Developers’ experience on working in ITHACA’s Open Source projects was also positively evaluated. More importantly, the potential contribution of the component-based framework and Open Source development model combination to the AAC community emerged.},

abstract = {While the financial consequences of software errors on the developer's side have been explored extensively, the cost arising for the end user has been largely neglected. One reason is the difficulty of linking errors in the code with emerging failure behavior of the software. The problem becomes even more difficult when trying to predict failure probabilities based on models or code metrics. In this paper we take a first step towards a cost prediction model by exploring the possibilities of modeling the financial consequences of already identified software failures. Firefox, a well-known open source software, is used as a test subject. Historically identified failures are modeled using fault trees. To identify expenses, usage profiles are employed to depict the interaction with the system. The presented approach demonstrates the possibility to model failure cost for an organization using a specific software by establishing a relationship between user behavior, software failures, and cost. As future work, an extension with software error prediction techniques as well as an empirical validation of the model is aspired.},

abstract = {Public development processes are a key characteristic of open source projects. However, fixes for vulnerabilities are usually discussed privately among a small group of trusted maintainers, and integrated without prior public involvement. This is supposed to prevent early disclosure, and cope with embargo and non-disclosure agreement (NDA) rules. While regular development activities leave publicly available traces, fixes for vulnerabilities that bypass the standard process do not.We present a data-mining based approach to detect code fragments that arise from such infringements of the standard process. By systematically mapping public development artefacts to source code repositories, we can exclude regular process activities, and infer irregularities that stem from non-public integration channels. For the Linux kernel, the most crucial component of many systems, we apply our method to a period of seven months before the release of Linux 5.4. We find 29 commits that address 12 vulnerabilities. For these vulnerabilities, our approach provides a temporal advantage of 2 to 179 days to design exploits before public disclosure takes place, and fixes are rolled out.Established responsible disclosure approaches in open development processes are supposed to limit premature visibility of security vulnerabilities. However, our approach shows that, instead, they open additional possibilities to uncover such changes that thwart the very premise. We conclude by discussing implications and partial countermeasures.},

One purpose of the website is outreach with real human interaction: anyone who is stuck solving an exercise can privately send a question to the "CS Circles Assistant" (the author and two colleagues). As part of this poster, we will show some information about the 2500 student questions we have answered through this system, e.g. the questions where students most often reach out for help. We will also provide feedback from teachers using the site with their own classes.The website was open-sourced in August 2013 thanks to a SIGCSE Special Projects grant, bringing it in line with the great open-source components used to create it. One unique outcome of this open licensing is installing a site mirror in a correctional institute.The website was originally launched in English and French. Since then, we have worked with CS institutes from other countries: versions in German and Dutch have been released, with other translations under way. The poster will highlight some tools and caveats involved in this process.Users of the site submit their solutions for online auto-grading, with about 500000 exercises now completed. This has yielded a large amount of data about the frequency of different error messages. We will include a chart of the most common errors, and an illustration of how we used this to generate clickable hints to give better beginner-level explanations for the most common errors.},

Specific hypotheses are developed and tested using longitudinal data on a large panel of 4,279 projects from 15 different OSS communities hosted at Sourceforge. Our results suggest that significant variation exists in small-world properties of OSS communities at Sourceforge. After accounting for project, foundry, and time-specific observed and unobserved effects, we found a statistically significant relationship between small-world properties of a community and the technical and commercial success of the software produced by its members. In contrast to the findings of prior research, we also found the lack of a significant relationship between closeness and betweenness centralities of the project teams and their success. These results were robust to a number of controls and model specifications.},

In order to prevent conflicts from deescalating and ensure effective teamwork, companies pay careful attention to the management of members' spatial, temporal and cultural distances. While initiatives developing Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) similarly combine a worldwide distributed workforce, relatively little is known about how members' separation affects their collaboration. However, without such an understanding no adequate advice can be derived for managers of FLOSS initiatives on how to foster members' collaboration and retention. Building on lessons learned from the organizational domain this research hypothesizes that spatial, temporal and cultural distances are key factors for FLOSS developers' team integration and project retention. To evaluate our research hypotheses, we study FLOSS developers' contribution and conversation behavior and extract objective figures on their spatial, temporal and cultural distances to each other.},

In contrast to the well documented workflows for georeferencing and curation of digitized historical maps, the challenges and costs of spatiotemporal data modelling and creation seem to pose a high barrier for individual researchers and institutions alike.This paper reflects on the challenges associated with the creation and reuse of large scale HGIS projects and puts forward a workflow which is currently being developed at the Hessische Institut fur Landesgeschichte (HIL) in Marburg aiming at reconstructing the (modern) administrative development of the federal state of Hessen and its preceding territories. To that effect, municipal districts ("Gemarkungen") are traced back in time utilizing a custom plugin for QGIS, an open-source geographic information system (GIS). The resulting PostGIS database table is linked to information on the relations to higher administrative units using Geo-Django, a python-based CMS with geospatial capabilities. Considering monetary aspects, preservation issues of the underlying data as well as the software systems utilized, the paper pleads for an open source, open data and overall cooperative approach in historical GIS projects.},

abstract = {Open source software is a natural fit in higher education as both are based on an 'open science' model of knowledge development, and collaborative learning. It also helps bridge the gap between knowledge production and its use whenever academics become involved with open source development contrary to the proprietary model where software is produced within the confines of commercial vendors R&amp;D labs. However in higher education, open source has not broken through the bottom of the software stack where it is confined to fulfilling mostly system computing requirements. At the application and visible level, open source adoption is hampered by a number of factors chief amongst these is the lack of reliable ICT governance structures. The problem is exacerbated in developing country contexts where governance in general is subjected to the power-play between several actors of the higher education scene. The governance conundrum faced by open source adoption in developing countries is illustrated through a detailed case study of an open source project failure at GNU, an American-style university in the Gulf region. The rise and fall of GNU open source project is discussed within a general framework of ICT and open source governance in developing countries higher education sector. Lessons are drawn from the case to recommend a FOSS strategy for development.},

MOOC platforms gather a continuous stream of learner traces, which can amount to several Gigabytes per MOOC, that learning analytics researchers use to conduct exploratory analyses as well as to evaluate deployed interventions. edX has proven to be a popular platform for such experiments, as the data each MOOC generates is easily accessible to the institution running the MOOC. One of the issues researchers face is the preprocessing, cleaning and formatting of those large-scale learner traces. It is a tedious process that requires considerable computational skills. To reduce this burden, a number of tools have been proposed and released with the aim of simplifying this process. Those tools though still have a significant setup cost, are already out-of-date or require already preprocessed data as a starting point. In contrast, in this paper we introduce ELAT, the edX Log file Analysis Tool, which is browser-based (i.e., no setup costs), keeps the data local (i.e., no server is necessary and the privacy-sensitive learner data is not send anywhere) and takes edX data dumps as input. ELAT does not only process the raw data, but also generates semantically meaningful units (learner sessions instead of just click events) that are visualized in various ways (learning paths, forum participation, video watching sequences). We report on two evaluations we conducted: (i) a technological evaluation and a (ii) user study with potential end users of ELAT. ELAT is open-source and available at https://mvallet91.github.io/ELAT/.},

abstract = {Modern heterogeneous SoCs (System-on-Chip) contain a set of Hard IPs (HIPs) surrounded by an FPGA fabric for hosting custom Hardware Accelerators (HAs). However, efficiently managing such HAs in an embedded Linux environment involves creating and building custom device drivers specific to the target platform, which negatively impacts development cost, portability and time-to-market. To address this issue, we present LEOSoC, an open-source cross-platform embedded Linux library. LEOSoC reduces the development effort required to interface HAs with applications and makes SoCs easy to use for an embedded software developer who is familiar with the semantics of standard POSIX threads. Using LEOSoC does not require any specific version of the Linux kernel, nor to rebuild a custom driver for each new kernel release. LEOSoC consists of a base hardware system and a software layer. Both hardware and software are portable across SoC from various vendors and the library recognizes and auto-adapts to the target SoC platform on which it is running. Furthermore, LEOSoC allows the application to partially or completely change the structure of the HAs at runtime without rebooting the system by leveraging the underlying platforms? support for dynamic full/partial FPGA reconfigurability. The system has been tested on multiple COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) boards from different vendors, each one running different versions of Linux and, therefore, proving the real portability and usability of LEOSoC in a specific industrial design.},

The majority of them is contributing for individual and personal reasons, aiming to create (intangible) value that is important to themselves. Besides that, users are today often not directly involved in the development process. This results in the need to have a software and management structure that actively aligns these different actors, pays respect to their needs, and involves them in the software creation process. We present the case of Catrobat and how different influences, e.g., by contributors, users, or stakeholders, affect the project and its development. We outline the challenges that occur in practice when it comes to an open software project situated in a complex ecosystem of different actors and highlight the requirements on such a project and how they are encountered in the presented case.},

These leads can then be forwarded to the sales team for follow-up and can result in them potentially making a sale, thus increasing company revenue.Method: For the analysis of the forums, an untapped channel for sales leads by the company, text analysis techniques are utilized to identify potential sales leads and the discussion topics and sentiments in those leads.Results: Results of our preliminary work make a positive contribution in lessening the community manager's work in understanding the sentiment and discussion topics in the hybrid open source forum community, as well as make it easier and faster to identify potential future customers.Conclusion: We believe that the results will positively contribute to improving the sales of licenses for the hybrid open source company.},

The reasons people engage in this seemingly altruistic behavior have been elaborated and classified. The present work addresses a slightly different issue: what motivates individuals to participate in community network projects? Are the reasons similar to or quite distinct from these relevant to contributors to free software? Based on recently conducted interviews with community network activists from the Germany based project Freifunk and established FLOSS motivation research, we will analyse the specifics of the Freifunk project and the factors which spur its members to action. The obtained insights could then hopefully be used to understand the underlying group processes and help build sustainable communities.},

As such, we had contributions on technical (such as the usefulness of automatic bug reporting tools, the implementation of standards, or linking various data sources), community-related (integration, congruence), economic (business models, or the impact of FLOSS in the growth of businesses), and fundamental (such as software forks) matters. We look forward to next year's OpenSym, which will take place 19-21 August 2015 in San Francisco, California, see http://opensym.org.},

abstract = {Open source communities hosted in large foundations operate in a complex socio-technical ecosystem, which includes a heterogeneous mix of projects and stakeholders. Previous work has thus far investigated the challenges faced in OSS communities from the point of view of specific stakeholders, primarily at the level of individual projects. None have yet studied the challenges faced within a large, federated open source organization. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap to identify ongoing challenges contributors face in a mature OSS organization. To do so, we surveyed 624 contributors at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) and ran 11 semi-structured follow up interviews. We validated our findings through member checking with the interviewees as well as the ASF Diversity and Inclusion (D&amp;I) committee. The contributions of this paper include: (1) an empirically-evidenced conceptual model of the 88 challenges that contributors face in a mature OSS foundation and (2) a set of 48 community-recommended strategies for alleviating these challenges. Our results show that even well-established and mature organizations still face a variety of individual and project-specific challenges and that it is difficult to design a comprehensive set of processes and guidelines to match the needs and expectations of a diverse and large federated community. Our conceptual challenges model and associated strategies to mitigate them can provide guidance to other OSS foundations and projects helping them in building better support processes and tools to create a successful, thriving community of contributors.},

abstract = {Many computer science programs have capstone experiences or project courses that allow students to integrate knowledge from the full breadth of their major. Such capstone projects may be student-designed, instructor-designed, designed in conjunction with outside companies, or integrated with ongoing free and open source (FOSS) projects. The literature shows that the FOSS approach has attracted a great deal of interest, in particular when implemented with projects that have humanitarian goals (HFOSS). In this article, we describe five unique models from five distinct types of institutions for incorporating sustained FOSS or HFOSS (alternatively H/FOSS) project work into capstone experiences or courses. The goal is to provide instructors wishing to integrate open source experiences into their curriculum with additional perspectives and resources to help in adapting this approach to the specific needs and goals of their institution and students. All of the models presented are based on sustained engagement with H/FOSS projects that last at least one semester and often more. Each model is described in terms of its characteristics and how it fits the needs of the institution using the model. Assessment of each model is also presented. We then discuss the themes that are common across the models, such as project selection, team formation, mentoring, and student assessment. We examine the choices made by each model, as well as the challenges faced. We end with a discussion how the models have leveraged institutional initiatives and collaborations with outside organizations to address some of the challenges associated with these projects.},

abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) development is a collaborative endeavor where expert developers, distributed around the globe create software solutions. Given this characteristic, OSS communities have been studied as technical communities, where stakeholders join and evolve in their careers based on their (often voluntary) code contributions to the project. However, the OSS landscape is slowly changing with more people and companies getting involved in OSS. This means that projects now need people in non-technical roles and activities to keep the project sustainable and evolving. In this paper, we focus on understanding the roles and activities that are part of the current OSS landscape and the different career pathways in OSS. By conducting and analyzing 17 interviews with OSS contributors who are well known in the community, we provide empirical evidence of the existence and importance of community-centric roles (e.g advocate, license manager, community founder) in addition to the well-known project-centric ones (e.g maintainer, core member). However, the community-centric roles typically remain hidden, since these roles may not leave traces in software repositories typically analyzed by researchers. We found that people can build a career in OSS through different roles and activities, with different backgrounds, including those not related to writing software. Furthermore, people's career pathways are fluid, moving between project and community-centric roles. Our work highlights that communities and researchers need to take action to acknowledge the importance of these varied roles, making these roles visible and well-recognized, which can ultimately help attract and retain more people in the OSS projects.},

This paper reports on our efforts to mitigate these challenges through the creation and use of Education-Oriented H/FOSS (Humanitarian FOSS or FOSS) projects - authentic open source projects consciously designed and managed to facilitate student and faculty engagement. We describe four active Education-Oriented H/FOSS projects and introduce a framework for illustrating different models of H/FOSS engagement. The framework is used to structure a discussion of the considerations and trade-offs of different engagement models, and highlights particular models that have been used to engage students and faculty in our four Education-Oriented H/FOSS projects. The framework positions projects along dimensions of professor involvement, responsibility for project hosting/management, mode of student knowledge and skill acquisition, and the curricular engagement goals. In doing so it broadly captures trade-offs that exist between the level of institutional resources used and the level of student independence required. It is anticipated this framework and the discussion that it organizes will be useful to faculty a) in evaluating the appropriateness of particular H/FOSS projects for use in their courses and curriculum and b) as guidance to those considering the creation of new Education-Oriented H/FOSS projects.},

abstract = {FAQ chatbots possess the capability to provide answers to frequently asked questions of a particular service, platform, or system. Currently, FAQ chatbot is the most popular domain of use of dialog assistants. However, developing a chatbot project requires a full-stack team formed by numerous specialists, such as dialog designer, data scientist, software engineer, DevOps, business strategist and experts from the domain, which can be both time and resources consuming. Language processing can be particularly challenging in languages other than English due to the scarcity of training datasets.Most of the requirements of FAQ chatbots are similar, domain-specific, and projects could profit from Open Source Software (OSS) reuse. In this paper, we examine how OSS FAQ chatbot projects can benefit from reuse at the project level (black-box reuse). We present an experience report of a FLOSS FAQ chatbot project developed in Portuguese to an e-government service in Brazil. It comprises of the chatbot distribution service, as well as for analytics tool integrated and deployed on-premises. We identified assets that could be reused as a black-box and the assets that should be customized for a particular application. We categorized these assets in architecture, corpus, dialog flows, machine learning models, and documentation. This paper discusses how automation, pre-configuration, and templates can aid newcomers to develop chatbots in Portuguese without the need for specialized skills required from tools in chatbot architecture. Our main contribution is to highlight the issues non-English FAQ chatbots projects will likely face and the assets that can be reused. It allows non-chatbot experts to develop a quality-assured OSS FAQ chatbot in a shorter project cycle.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown the benefits of introducing open-source projects into teaching Software Engineering (SE) courses. However, there are several limitations of existing studies that limit the wide adaptation of open-source projects in a classroom setting, including (1) the selected project is limited to one particular project, (2) most studies only investigated on its effect on teaching a specific SE concept, and (3) students may make mistakes in their contribution which leads to poor quality code. Meanwhile, software companies have successfully launched programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and FindBugs "fixit" to contribute to open-source projects. Inspired by the success of these programs, we propose GitHub-OSS Fixit, a team-based course project where students are taught to contribute to open-source Java projects by fixing bugs reported in GitHub. We described our course outline to teach students SE concepts by encouraging the usages of several automated program analysis tools. We also included the carefully designed instructions that we gave to students for participating in GitHub-OSS Fixit. As all lectures and labs are conducted online, we think that our course design could help in guiding future online SE courses. Overall, our survey results show that students think that GitHub-OSS Fixit could help them to improve many skills and apply the knowledge taught in class. In total, 154 students have submitted 214 pull requests to 24 different Java projects, in which 93 of them have been merged, and 46 have been closed by developers.},

Through a study of workers from two organizations working on FLOSS projects we identify the boundaries, in terms of productivity and quality of life, of virtual work and actions workers take in order to find a work-life balance. We found that although workers valued the flexibility of working from home, they had difficulty focusing on their work for sustained time periods and often felt isolated. This motivated them to use coworking spaces - physical spaces used as work space by workers not on the same team or even the same firm - as a critical part of their space ecology. In conjunction with their media ecology - a mix of communication technologies including IRC - the space/media mix allowed them to balance their work and personal lives. We draw implications for better supporting FLOSS and virtual work practices through design of media/space and work practices.},

abstract = {Reliance on data for software systems engineering is increasing, e.g., to train machine learning applications. We foresee increasing costs for data collection and maintenance, leading to the risk of development budgets eaten up by commodity features, thus leaving little resources for differentiation and innovation. We therefore propose Open Collaborative Data (OCD) - a concept analogous to Open Source Software (OSS) - as a means to share data. In contrast to Open Data (OD), which e.g., governmental agencies provide to catalyze innovation, OCD is shared in open collaboration between commercial organizations, similar to OSS. To achieve this, there is a need for technical infrastructure (e.g., tools for version and access control), licence models, and governance models, all of which have to be tailored for data. However, as data may be sensitive for privacy, anonymization and obfuscation of data is also a research challenge. In this paper, we define the concept of Open Collaborative Data, demonstrate it by map data and image recognition examples, and outline a research agenda for OCD in software engineering as a basis for more efficient evolution of software systems.},

The voluntary, self-organizing distribution of decentralized labor and the distinct nature of some OSS projects intensifies this challenge. Mentors, who work closely with newcomers, develop strategies to recommend tasks. However, to date neither the challenges mentors face in recommending tasks nor their strategies have been formally documented or studied. In this paper, we interviewed mentors of well-established OSS projects (n=10) and qualitatively analyzed their answers to identify both challenges and strategies related to recommending tasks for newcomers. Then, we employed a survey (n=30) to map the strategies to challenges and collect additional strategies. Our study identified 7 challenges and 13 strategies related to task recommendation. Strategies such as "tagging the issues based on difficulty," "adding documentation," "assigning a small task first and then challenge the newcomers with bigger tasks," and "dividing tasks into smaller pieces" were frequently mentioned as ways to overcome multiple challenges. Our results provide insights for mentors about the strategies OSS communities can use to guide their mentors and for tool builders who design automated support for task assignment.},

abstract = {OSS-based learning refers to using open source software (OSS) and their sociotechnical practices in the pedagogical context. Several educators reported its benefits and barriers within different contexts, goals, and areas of knowledge, bringing evidence that it is a feasible approach to address Software Engineering Education challenges. Some appealing factors to adopting OSS-based learning are the availability of the software source code and workflows, access to the OSS community, and information about its development and evolution, which may improve the learning of SE concepts and practices and foster students’ engagement in real-world projects. Observing students as they work towards hard and soft skills, understanding, engaging with, and eventually contributing to an OSS project is a rewarding part of the routine of educators who have recognized the benefits of OSS-based learning and adopted it in their classes. We report our experience after delivering a “hands-on” course to introduce graduate students to OSS projects and their sociotechnical practices. Some graduate students were higher education instructors in other institutions. We present the course design and details of its execution, followed by a reflection based on students’ feedback and our perceptions of gains and pains. Overall, students valued the course and were highly motivated to explore OSS, especially those who worked as educators. Most of the feedback concerning the course methodology was positive, but some students requested more information about the weekly lesson plans in advance. We hope this experience report helps to demystify OSS, inspire educators to adopt OSS projects in their courses, and foster instructors’ and students’ engagement with OSS projects.},

abstract = {Open source software (OSS) is increasingly being developed by hybrid teams that consist of a mix of company employees and volunteer developers. While hybrid OSS teams are becoming more prevalent, they also face unique challenges due to the involvement of different constituents. To address those challenges, this paper develops and validates a new organizing model. Specifically, the paper draws on media synchronicity theory (MST) to theorize that hybrid OSS teams would benefit from adopting an organizing model that involves practicing agile methods and using communication tools with multiple symbols sets and high transmission velocity. The paper also extends MST by conceptualizing the theory's key concept of communication convergence as consisting of two distinct dimensions: affective and cognitive convergence. Using primary survey data from hybrid OSS teams, the paper presents empirical evidence that such an organizing model can enhance those teams' affective convergence and cognitive convergence and, in turn, their development productivity and the quality of the software. In addition, the results show that affective convergence has a stronger impact on hybrid OSS teams' performance than cognitive convergence.},

abstract = {Governance has been highlighted as a key factor in the success of an Open Source Software (OSS) project. It is generally seen that in a mixed meritocracy and autocracy governance model, the decision-making (DM) responsibility regarding what features are included in the OSS is shared among members from select roles; prominently the project leader. However, less examination has been made whether members from these roles are also prominent in DM discussions and how decisions are made, to show they play an integral role in the success of the project. We believe that to establish their influence, it is necessary to examine not only discussions of proposals in which the project leader makes the decisions, but also those where others make the decisions. Therefore, in this study, we examine the prominence of members performing different roles in: (i) making decisions, (ii) performing certain social roles in DM discussions (e.g., discussion starters), (iii) contributing to the OSS development social network through DM discussions, and (iv) how decisions are made under both scenarios. We examine these aspects in the evolution of the well-known Python project. We carried out a data-driven longitudinal study of their email communication spanning 20 years, comprising about 1.5 million emails. These emails contain decisions for 466 Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) that document the language’s evolution. Our findings make the influence of different roles transparent to future (new) members, other stakeholders, and more broadly, to the OSS research community.},

While previous research recognizes the significance of trust in an organizational setting, there is a lack of understanding in how trust is exhibited in OSS distributed teams, where there is an absence of direct, in-person communications. To foster trust and collaboration in OSS teams, we need to understand what trust is and how it is exhibited in written developer communications (e.g., pull requests, chats). In this paper, we first investigate various dimensions of trust to identify the ways trusting behavior can be observed in OSS. Next, we sample a set of 100 GitHub pull requests from Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects, to analyze and demonstrate how each dimension of trust can be exhibited. Our findings provide preliminary insights into cues that might be helpful to automatically assess team dynamics and establish interpersonal trust in OSS teams, leading to successful and sustainable OSS.},

abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) projects play a critical role in the digital infrastructure of companies and services provided to millions of people. Given their importance, understanding the resilience of OSS projects is paramount. A primary reason for OSS project failure is the shock caused by the dropout of a core developer, which can jeopardize productivity and project survival. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis, this study investigates the repercussions of this shock on the productivity of 8,234 developers identified among 9,573 OSS GitHub projects. Our findings reveal the indirect impact of the core developer's dropout. The remaining developers experienced a 20\% productivity drop. This observation is troubling because it suggests that the shock might push other developers to drop out, putting the collaboration structure of the project at risk. Also, projects with higher productivity before the shock experienced a larger drop-down after the shock. This points to a tradeoff between productivity and resilience, i.e., the ability of OSS projects to recover from the dropout of a core developer. Our findings underscore the importance of a balanced approach in OSS project management, harmonizing productivity goals with resilience considerations.},

Some large ecosystems enjoy the participation of large numbers of companies, each of which has its own focus and goals. Indeed, companies that otherwise compete, may become collaborators within the OSS ecosystem they participate in. Prior research has largely focused on commercial involvement in OSS projects, but there is a scarcity of research focusing on company collaborations within OSS ecosystems. Some of these ecosystems have become critical building blocks for organizations worldwide; hence, a clear understanding of how companies collaborate within large ecosystems is essential. This paper presents the results of an empirical study of the OpenStack ecosystem, in which hundreds of companies collaborate on thousands of project repositories to deliver cloud distributions. Based on a detailed analysis, we identify clusters of collaborations, and identify four strategies that companies adopt to engage with the OpenStack ecosystem. We alsofind that companies may engage in intentional or passive collaborations, or may work in an isolated fashion. Further, wefi nd that a com-pany's position in the collaboration network is positively associated with its productivity in OpenStack. Our study sheds light on howlarge OSS ecosystems work, and in particular on the patterns of collaboration within one such large ecosystem.},

  abstract={The majority of contributions to community open source software (OSS) projects are made by practitioners acting on behalf of companies and other organisations. Previous research has addressed the motivations of both individuals and companies to engage with OSS projects. However, limited research has been undertaken that examines and explains the practical mechanisms or work practices used by companies and their developers to pursue their commercial and technical objectives when engaging with OSS projects. This research investigates the variety of work practices used in public communication channels by company contributors to engage with and contribute to eight community OSS projects. Through interviews with contributors to the eight projects we draw on their experiences and insights to explore the motivations to use particular methods of contribution. We find that companies utilise work practices for contributing to community projects which are congruent with the circumstances and their capabilities that support their short- and long-term needs. We also find that companies contribute to community OSS projects in ways that may not always be apparent from public sources, such as employing core project developers, making donations, and joining project steering committees in order to advance strategic interests. The factors influencing contributor work practices can be complex and are often dynamic arising from considerations such as company and project structure, as well as technical concerns and commercial strategies. The business context in which software created by the OSS project is deployed is also found to influence contributor work practices.},

  abstract={Commercial participation continues to grow in free/libre open source software (FLOSS) projects. Companies may take the lead in developing FLOSS rather than volunteers, which may change the nature of FLOSS development and affect the FLOSS community. Despite substantial research on commercial participation, it remains unclear whether companies dominate FLOSS development, to what extent the domination exists and whether the domination affects the FLOSS community. We therefore conduct an empirical study on OpenStack with a focus on its four main projects (Nova, Swift, Glance, and Neutron) to explore the commercial domination. We employ the development data of the four projects to quantify companies' contributions from two aspects: the developers they provided and the commits made by those developers. We find that there are nearly half of the versions, in which the four projects are dominated by one company. The dominant companies change occasionally, but the number never exceeds three for any project. We found that the commercial domination is negatively associated with the participation of companies and contributors, while it is positively associated with the productivity of contributors and the quality of issue reports. Our study contributes to the understanding of commercial domination and its impact on FLOSS community. Our findings reveal the adverse consequences brought by commercial domination in addition to its benefits.},

  abstract={Cyber security is one of the most critical problems faced by enterprises, government organizations, education institutes, small and medium scale businesses, and medical institutions today. Creating a cyber security posture through proper cyber security architecture, deployment of cyber defense tools, and building a security operation center are critical for all such organizations given the preponderance of cyber threats. However, cyber defense tools are expensive, and many small and medium-scale business houses cannot procure these tools within their budgets. Even those business houses that manage to procure them cannot use them effectively because of the lack of human resources and the knowledge of the standard enterprise security architecture. In 2020, the C3i Center at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur developed a professional certification course where IT professionals from various organizations go through rigorous six-month long training in cyber defense. During their training, groups within the cohort collaborate on team projects to develop cybersecurity solutions for problems such as malware analysis, threat intelligence collection, endpoint detection and protection, network intrusion detection, developing security incidents, event management systems, etc. All these projects leverage open-source tools, and code from various sources, and hence can be also constructed by others if the recipe to construct such tools is known. It is therefore beneficial if we put these recipes out in the form of book chapters such that small and medium scale businesses can create these tools based on open-source components, easily following the content of the chapters. In 2021, we published the first volume of this series based on the projects done by cohort 1 of the course. This volume, second in the series has new recipes and tool development expertise based on the projects done by cohort 3 of this training program. This volume consists of nine chapters that describe experience and know-how of projects in malware analysis, web application security, intrusion detection system, and honeypot in sufficient detail so they can be recreated by anyone looking to develop home grown solutions to defend themselves from cyber-attacks.},

  abstract={Commercial participation continues to grow in open source software (OSS) projects and novel arrangements appear to emerge in company-dominated projects and ecosystems. What is the nature of these novel arrangements? Does volunteers’ participation remain critical for these ecosystems? Despite extensive research on commercial participation in OSS, the exact nature and extent of company contributions to OSS development, and the impact of this engagement may have on the volunteer community have not been clarified. To bridge the gap, we perform an exploratory study of OpenStack: a large OSS ecosystem with intense commercial participation. We quantify companies’ contributions via the developers that they provide and the commits made by those developers. We find that companies made far more contributions than volunteers and the distribution of the contributions made by different companies is also highly unbalanced. We observe eight unique contribution models based on companies’ commercial objectives and characterize each model according to three dimensions: contribution intensity, extent, and focus. Companies providing full cloud solutions tend to make both intensive (more than other companies) and extensive (involving a wider variety of projects) contributions. Usage-oriented companies make extensive but less intense contributions. Companies driven by particular business needs focus their contributions on the specific projects addressing these needs. Minor contributors include community players (e.g., the Linux Foundation) and research groups. A model relating the number of volunteers to the diversity of contribution shows a strong positive association between them.},

To achieve this, VALS builds knowledge partnerships between Higher Education and companies who work together on resolving authentic business problems through open innovation. The innovative approach is to leverage virtual placements of informatics students in companies in order to foster entrepreneurial skills and attitudes, and to make use of the results to establish new learning and teaching methods. This results in the Semester of Code initiative, a set of methods and processes for creating and managing a real virtual placement, and for integrating this into innovative teaching and learning strategy. To show these methods and processes, this paper describes the general methodology designed to perform the Semester of Code, as well as several guidelines on how to develop the software that will support this process. Also describes a real adaptation of theoretical approach of this whole process in the case of an Academic Institution, including comprehensively all the issues affecting the process implementation in a real context.},

  abstract={Background: The adoption of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FOSS) by institutions is significantly increasing, and so is the affiliated participation (the participation of industry engineers in open source communities as part of their jobs). Aims: This study is an investigation into affiliated participation in FOSS communities. So far, little is known about the affiliated participation and the forces that influence it, even though the FOSS innovation model is increasingly becoming a serious contender for the private investment model in many sectors. Method: We present a qualitative inquiry into affiliated participation in the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Linux Kernel communities, using twenty-one in-depth interviews and participatory observation data from twenty-nine community events. Results: Our results show that affiliated participation in these communities is constrained by several barriers: objections of senior management, protection of the company's image, protection of intellectual property, undefined processes and policies, the high cost of participation, and unfamiliarity with the FOSS system. Conclusions: These barriers should be addressed in any organization considering using FOSS as a significant acquisition, distribution, and development strategy.},

  abstract={In an open source software (OSS) development community supported by spontaneous volunteers, personal interests, technical capabilities, hunger for fame, and the satisfaction of contributing to the public good are said to be motivating factor for participation. In that community, companies always play auxiliary roles, and integrate the result of OSS into their business activities. However, in the Eclipse open source software community, the main role of OSS development activities is taken over by companies. The relationship between individuals and companies is reversed. Therefore, it becomes important to maintain the motivation of the development community, promote innovation and link the activities to the profit of a company. In other words, management of co-creation and competition are being conducted at the same time. This paper tries to clarify a structure of co-creation in an OSS ecosystem led by companies considering the Eclipse community as one particular case. It also constructs a co-creation process model to promote sustainable development for an OSS ecosystem following two axes 1) value sharing and value acquisition, and 2) quantitative development and qualitative development. Some mechanisms that drive this process are embedded everywhere in the Eclipse ecosystem.},

This analysis reveals a unique process, which performs well on important measures. We conclude that hybrid forms of development that borrow the most effective techniques from both the OSS and commercial worlds may lead to high performance software processes.},

SMS marketing involves simultaneously sending messages to a large number of people. SMS Marketing is a kind of permission-based completely hobby, and can’t buy a mobile phone or smartphone. Keywords are the easiest way to attract and gather customers for SMS provider. Keywords are short, easy-to-remember phrases that help potential customers benefit from promotions by inviting them via SMS.

Utilizing cutting-edge, most well-known and potent forms of communication, sales, service, operations, and client retention can be improved. You could send messages to many people at once by using this platform. In order to automate personalized text message responses tailored entirely to the company’s requirements, it routinely collects membership information and routinely creates an opt-in SMS database. It has the capability of automating SMS marketing and advertising. The developed machine instructs clients to enter an Excel spreadsheet and add the contacts they wish to ship.

  abstract={The Tool-and-Die making industry in Eastern Europe faces stringent competition due to globalization. Most European companies are highly specialised SMEs producing complex one-of-a-kind products used in mass production. Inter-organisational collaboration not only requires changes in organisational structures but also the ability to exchange business information, retrieve it, access it, process it and electronically communicate it to all the actors involved in any given business transaction. To do this, SMEs require collaborative ICT tools and internet platform that enable seamless information exchange. There are a number of ICT solutions and middleware which support such collaboration, but these are often not affordable or suitable for SMEs. This article presents an initiative aiming at improving the collaboration ability of SMEs by introducing a concept comprising a specific business process reference model and a modular open source-based collaboration tool with ERP/CRM functionalities, which can be integrated into already existing software systems allowing seamless information processing. Thereby, it will strengthen the competitiveness of Eastern European SMEs as well as improve their ability to collaborate.},

  abstract={Open source components are ubiquitous in companies’ setups, processes, and software. Utilizing these external components as building blocks enables companies to leverage the benefits of open source software, allowing them to focus their efforts on features and faster delivery instead of writing their own components. But by introducing these components into their software stack, companies inherit unique security challenges and attack surfaces: including code from potentially unvetted contributors and obligations to assess and mitigate the impact of vulnerabilities in external components.In 25 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with software developers, architects, and engineers from industry projects, we investigate their projects’ processes, decisions, and considerations in the context of external open source code. We find that open source components play an important role in many of our participants’ projects, that most projects have some form of company policy or at least best practice for including external code, and that many developers wish for more developer-hours, dedicated teams, or tools to better audit included components. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for company stakeholders and the open source software ecosystem. Overall, we appeal to companies to not treat the open source ecosystem as a free (software) supply chain and instead to contribute towards the health and security of the overall software ecosystem they benefit from and are part of.},

  abstract={Professionals contribute to open source software (OSS) projects as part of their employment. Previous research has addressed motivations of individuals and the ways they engage with OSS projects. However, there is a lack of research which examines and explains work practices used by companies in their engagement with projects. Work practices used by companies to contribute to five established OSS projects are investigated through examination of the actions of employees in public communication channels and draw on our experiences when analysing engagement with the same projects. We find that companies utilise work practices for contributing which are congruent with the circumstances and their capabilities that support their short and long term needs. We find that companies contribute to OSS projects in different ways, such as employing core project developers, making donations, and joining project steering committees in order to advance strategic interests.},

  abstract={As the benefits of Moore's Law diminish, computing performance, and efficiency gains are increasingly achieved through specializing hardware to a domain of computation. However, this limits the hardware's generality and flexibility. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), microchips which can be reprogrammed to implement arbitrary digital circuits, enable the benefits of specialization while remaining flexible. A challenge to using FPGAs is the complex computer-aided design flow required to efficiently map a computation onto an FPGA. Traditionally, these design flows are closed-source and highly specialized to a particular vendor's devices. We propose an alternate data-driven approach, which uses highly adaptable and retargettable open-source tools to target both commercial and research FPGA architectures. While challenges remain, we believe this approach makes the development of novel and commercial FPGA architectures faster and more accessible. Furthermore, it provides a path forward for industry, academia, and the open-source community to collaborate and combine their resources to advance FPGA technology.},

  abstract={Technical progress in production technology, the advancement and spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) as well as the spill-over of the highly efficient and innovative open source principles to the world of physical products represent a new set of tools and concepts to address the challenges of sustainable economic development. Correspondingly, we can observe (new) modes of value creation that put into question traditional economic strategies and assumptions by stressing collaboration instead of competition and knowledge sharing instead of black box engineering. Open Source Ecology (OSE) is a famous example of a nonprofit organization which fosters worldwide participation and collaboration to jointly develop open source hardware for operation in both developing and industrialized countries. Based on the concepts open source appropriate technology (OSAT), the community aims at the free access to the knowledge and knowhow of low-cost and easy-to-build products to empower people to build and run a civilization. This case study describes and analyzes the value creation processes of OSE and derives new opportunities for business models based on openness.},

  abstract={The Tool and Die-making industry in Eastern Europe faces strong competition from the Far East. Most European companies are highly specialised SMEs producing complex one-of-a-kind products used in mass production. The customers are mainly large global players expecting faster, cheaper and more efficient delivery of the complex tools. Often SMEs do not have resources to response to these requirements alone. It is therefore imperative to form sustainable collaborative networks. Inter-organisational collaboration not only requires changes in organisational structures but also the ability to exchange business information, retrieve it, access it, process it and electronically communicate it to all the actors involved in any given business transaction. To do this, SMEs require collaborative ICT tools that enable seamless information exchange. There are a number of ICT solutions and middleware which support such collaboration, but these are often not affordable or suitable for SMEs, which in Europe, average less than ten employees. This article presents an initiative aiming at improving the collaboration ability of SMEs by introducing a concept comprising a specific business process reference model and a modular open source-based collaboration tool with ERP/CRM functionalities, which can be integrated into already existing software systems allowing seamless information processing. Thereby, it will strengthen the competitiveness of Eastern European SMEs as well as improve their ability to collaborate. The approach presented in the proposed paper is basing on the work carried out by the European funded research project Tool-East (EC Contract No. IST-FP6-027802)},

  pages={8 pp.-},
  abstract={Open source information on the Internet can contribute significantly to such assessments as competitive intelligence, business trends, or evolving social attitudes. Unfortunately, this information is mostly unstructured text, and varies widely in accuracy, focus, and level of impartiality. Estimates on factors important to planning and decision-making, such as likely responses of competitors to a corporation's market actions, can be inferred from competitors' past actions, their corporate strengths and interests, and their executives' personalities. Elements related to these factors can be gleaned from press releases, historical records, and corporate profile information. To make the overall assessment, these elements must be combined. This paper describes a methodology for fusion of open source information now under development for a major U.S. government organization. This process employs formal ontologies for the fusion domain and for evidential reasoning, a commercial tool for text extraction and structuring, and tools to help operators review, edit, and augment the fusion products. It features a fusion pedigree to document the audit trail of sources and processes contributing to a fusion product. The fusion steps are: 1) collect structured and unstructured information related to the entity or event of interest; 2) extract and structure free text; 3) create "event reports" from each structured record, whether derived from free text or previously structured sources; 4) create ontology-based communication reports from these records, 5) associate these reports, 6) cue manual search for additional information, and 7) fuse the information.},

  abstract={This keynote address takes the perspective of open source software to look at some of the policy issues arising from the ever increasing impact of software systems on people's lives. It contends that open source can facilitate public regulation by fostering open cooperation and counter-balancing current oligopoly and vertical integration trends in the IT industry. Thirty years ago, Richard Stallman, and then the Free Software Foundation, invented free software, an efficient techno-legal construct to share code development efforts with traces of anti-monopolistic values. Thanks to new permissive licenses some 15 years later, free software was forked into open source - a business movement and outsider's strategy par excellence. And now, a third kind of open source is emerging, driving innovation as IT applications become increasingly social, diverse and complex. Developers “scratching an itch”, investors copying leaders in existing market segments, and committees exploring new grounds, requirement management are always a reflection of current industry drivers. Moreover, while dominant vertically integrated oligopolistic players with no incentive for transparency nor regulation are re-shaping the IT industry and our digital economy, open source collaborative R&D provides an alternative evolution path based on open standards and componentized software stacks. Identifying the issues at stake and implementing the mechanisms to interact with the industry, without interfering with market forces, are some of the greatest challenges facing policy makers.},

  abstract={The use of open source software has become a part of accepted business strategies. A primary strength of open source software is its leverage of outside innovation. All are free to take open source software and use it, evaluate it, repair it, and add new capabilities. One perceived risk of using open source software components in commercial systems is open source project sustainability. It would be expensive for the project supporting a critical open source component to fail midway through the life cycle of a commercial product. Many commercial organizations reduce this risk by contributing to the open source projects that they use. However, the "contribution barrier" for successful open source software projects is high, especially for commercial contributors. This barrier has technical and social components, both of which are exacerbated by minimal attention paid to good management practices. This paper proposes a process for managing open source software "patch" (source code and documentation change) contributions. By observation and by examination of current literature we identify key practices for patch creation, publication, discovery, review, and, application. An improved patch contribution process will lower the contribution barrier, helping to improve the sustainability of critical open source projects.},

  pages={400-410},
  abstract={Developers of open-source software projects tend to collaborate in bursts of activity over a few days at a time, rather than at an even pace. A project might find its productivity suffering if bursts of activity occur when a key person with the right role or right expertise is not available to participate. Open-source projects could benefit from monitoring the way they orchestrate attention among key developers, finding ways to make themselves available to one another when needed. In commercial software development, Sociotechnical Congruence (STC) has been used as a measure to assess whether coordination among developers is sufficient for a given task. However, STC has not previously been successfully applied to open-source projects, in which some industrial assumptions do not apply: management-chosen targets, mandated steady work hours, and top-down task allocation of inputs and targets. In this work we propose an operationalization of STC for open-source software development. We use temporal bursts of activity as a unit of analysis more suited to the natural rhythms of open-source work, as well as open source analogues of other component measures needed for calculating STC. As an illustration, we demonstrate that open-source development on PyPI projects in GitHub is indeed bursty, that activities in the bursts have topical coherence, and we apply our operationalization of STC. We argue that a measure of socio-technical congruence adapted to open source could provide projects with a better way of tracking how effectively they are collaborating when they come together to collaborate.},

The rubric is situated within the context of the company’s business objectives as well as within the concerns of the field, such as content strategy, usability, accessibility, and discoverability. The rubric is divided into three parts: decisions about the content itself, content operations for lifecycle maintenance, and content access. Practitioners can use the rubric to inform their content strategy across enterprise and open source documentation. Academics might find the rubric helpful as a teaching tool for content strategy courses.

  abstract={Cyber security is one of the most critical problems faced by enterprises, government organizations, education institutes, small and medium scale businesses, and medical institutions today. Creating a cyber security posture through proper cyber security architecture, deployment of cyber defense tools, and building a security operation center are critical for all such organizations given the preponderance of cyber threats. However, cyber defense tools are expensive, and many small and medium-scale business houses cannot procure these tools within their budgets. Even those business houses that manage to procure them cannot use them effectively because of the lack of human resources and the knowledge of the standard enterprise security architecture. In 2020, the C3i Center at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur developed a professional certification course where IT professionals from various organizations go through rigorous six-month long training in cyber defense. During their training, groups within the cohort collaborate on team projects to develop cybersecurity solutions for problems such as malware analysis, threat intelligence collection, endpoint detection and protection, network intrusion detection, developing security incidents, event management systems, etc. All these projects leverage open-source tools, and code from various sources, and hence can be also constructed by others if the recipe to construct such tools is known. It is therefore beneficial if we put these recipes out in the form of book chapters such that small and medium scale businesses can create these tools based on open-source components, easily following the content of the chapters. In 2021, we published the first volume of this series based on the projects done by cohort 1 of the course. This volume, second in the series has new recipes and tool development expertise based on the projects done by cohort 3 of this training program. This volume consists of nine chapters that describe experience and know-how of projects in malware analysis, web application security, intrusion detection system, and honeypot in sufficient detail so they can be recreated by anyone looking to develop home grown solutions to defend themselves from cyber-attacks.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={43378-43395},
  abstract={In this work, we present an open-source unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for research in swarm robotics. In swarm robotics, groups of robots collaborate using local interactions and collectively solve tasks beyond an individual robot’s capabilities. Individual robots must have onboard processing, communication, and sensing capabilities to autonomously react to their neighbors and immediate environment. Most research involving UAVs in swarm robotics presents only simulation results, while key landmark studies with real UAV swarms have used UAV platforms that were custom-built for the respective study. One important reason for this is that no commercial UAV platform comes pre-equipped with the ability to identify and track the positions and poses of nearby drones using only onboard sensors and computation, and in research platforms, the relevant sensing technologies are currently under development. Our aim is to provide a platform that allows swarm robotics researchers to test their algorithms on real UAVs, without having to develop their own custom-built UAVs or to wait until more advanced sensing technology is ready off-the-shelf. We provide a well-documented, entirely open-source UAV platform— S-drone (Swarm-drone)—to foster and support UAV swarm research in a laboratory environment. The S-drone uses fiducial markers in the environment and cooperative feature-level sensor fusion for inter-robot tracking to track the presence, identity, relative 2D position, and relative 2D orientation of neighboring peers. The S-drone is suitable for a wide range of contexts, supports quad-camera vision-based navigation and a variety of onboard sensing, and is extensible. It is especially suited for swarm robotics research because it can operate using strictly onboard processing and sensing without the need for global positioning systems, motion capture systems, or ground stations for off-board sensing.},

  abstract={Electrified transportation has emerged as a trend to support energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction targets. Electric (road) vehicles are one of the main features associated with transportation electrification. They aim to reduce the use of non-renewable vehicle's fuel resources (Petrol, Diesel, etc.) and depend on renewable energy. However, EVs interact with three interconnected systems: the transportation system, the electric power grid, and their supporting information systems often called intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Therefore, the true success of electric vehicles depends on their successful integration with the infrastructure systems that support them. Consequently, transportation electrification as a new trend requires simulation tools that are capable of building-up schemes close to real life scenarios. This paper presents a benchmark analysis of open source transportation electrification simulation tools. The holistic assessment consists of a 2 level analysis. First, a list of available traffic simulation tools open source and commercial is classified into macro, meso and microscopic simulators. Second, an in-depth comparison analysis is conducted for only micro & mesoscopic open source tools. This analysis aims to depict the overall features of these tools such as inclusion of electric vehicle functionality, source-code accessibility & customizability and simulation performance. The study finds that while none of these tools has truly addressed the breadth of transportation electrification research, MATSIM, SUMO and TRANSIMS all have promising characteristics for future development.},

We hardly see any longer the traditional way of software development in which one company handles design, production, sales, delivery, and service. Business models, engineering life cycles, distribution channels, and services have changed dramatically. A key driver in these new value networks is open source software (OSS). Open source refers to software that we may freely use, modify, or distribute, provided we observe certain restrictions with respect to copyright and protection of its open source status. OSS is not freeware and generally has a copyright. IEEE Software, through this paper, has assembled this minitheme to provide a glimpse of where OSS is heading.},

By drawing a parallel between the amount of available employment and education in an area to the overall participation of developers in FLOSS activities, I argue here that expanding the number of participants in the high-tech sector could increase the number of developers in other countries who choose to participate in open source projects. This analysis posits a kind of symbiotic relationship between commercial and private sector software development, which has not previously been taken. While these modes of software production continue to expand internationally, we gain a unique opportunity for expanding our understanding of the consequences of offshoring. Furthermore, the liberatory promise of FLOSS projects can only be realized if educated and motivated individuals are present in other countries. Without this expansion, it will remain an activity dominated by America and Western Europe},
