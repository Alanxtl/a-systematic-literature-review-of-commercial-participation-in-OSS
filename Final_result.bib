   Abstract = {In this study, we investigate the effect of takeover announcements made by open-source software (OSS) steward firms, on participation in an OSS newcomers' online community. We examine a MySQL newcomer forum before and after two takeover announcements -- the January 2008 announcement of MySQL's takeover by Sun Microsystems, and the April 2009 announcement of Sun's takeover by Oracle. We find that the impact on participation depends on how the acquiring company is perceived. The announcement of an acquisition by a company perceived as hostile had a negative effect on participation, whereas announcement of acquisition by a more friendly company was found to have no effect on participation. These changes in participation occurred without any accompanying change in the product itself, or its licensing. This work provides the evidence of the effect of external events on online participation.},

   Abstract = {Information technology (IT) firms are paying developers in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects, leading to the emergence of hybrid forms of work. In order to understand how the firm–project hybridisation process occurs, we present the results of an online survey of participants in the Debian project, as well as interviews with Debian Developers. We find that the intermingling of the commercial logic of the firm and the communal logic of the project requires rhetorical legitimation. We analyse the discourses used to legitimise firm–project cooperation as well as the organisational mechanisms which facilitate this cooperation. A first phase of legitimation, based on firm adoption of open licenses and developer self-fulfilment, aims to erase the commercial/communal divide. A second more recent phase seeks to professionalise work relations inside the project and, in doing so, challenges the social order which restricts participation in FOSS. Ultimately, hybridisation raises the question of the fair distribution of the profits firms derive from FOSS. © The Author(s) 2020.},

   Abstract = {Open source practices and tools have proven to be highly effective for overcoming the many problems of geographically distributed software development. We know relatively little, however, about the range of settings in which they work. In particular, can corporations use the open source development model effectively for software projects inside the corporate domain? Or are these tools and practices incompatible with development environments, management practices, and market-driven schedule and feature decisions typical of a commercial software house? We present a case study of open source software development methodology adopted by a significant commercial software project in the telecommunications domain. We extract a number of lessons learned from the experience, and identify open research questions.},

   Abstract = {Open source licenses provide everyone with the legal right to use, study, share, and improve the technology they cover from the perspective of copyright law. However, there are occasions when open source software packages or projects primarily governed by copyright licenses come into potential conflict with patent issues, or suffer from other governance concerns regarding third-party Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). From an economic perspective it is interesting how instead of undermining adoption, such challenges have led to an increase of collaborative governance solutions in open source, perhaps inspired by how such collaboration in development and business matters has provided benefit to stakeholders. In this paper, we show this evolution of collaborative solutions in open source business by actual example, and in the process illustrate how this unique approach to dealing with diverse ownership across business sectors works in practice.},

   Abstract = {Context: The popularity of the open source software development in the last decade, has brought about an increased interest from the industry on how to use open source components, participate in the open source community, build business models around this type of software development, and learn more about open source development methodologies. There is a need to understand the results of research in this area. Objective: Since there is a need to understand conducted research, the aim of this study is to summarize the findings of research that has ben carried out on usage of open source components and development methodologies by the industry, as well as companies' participation in the open source community. Method: Systematic review through searches in library databases and manual identification of articles from the open source conference. The search was first carried out in May 2009 and then once again in May 2010. Results: In 2009, 237 articles were first found, from which 19 were selected based on content and quality, and in 2010, 76 new articles were found from which four were selected. Twenty three articles were identified in total. Conclusions: The articles could be divided into four categories: open source as part of component based software engineering, business models with open source in commercial organization, company participation in open source development communities, and usage of open source processes within a company. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   Abstract = {The relationship among software design quality, development effort, and governance practices is a traditional research problem. However, the extent to which consolidated results on this relationship remain valid for open source (OS) projects is an open research problem. An emerging body of literature contrasts the view of open source as an alternative to proprietary software and explains that there exists a continuum between closed and open source projects. This paper hypothesizes that as projects approach the OS end of the continuum, governance becomes less formal. In turn a less formal governance is hypothesized to require a higher-quality code as a means to facilitate coordination among developers by making the structure of code explicit and facilitate quality by removing the pressure of deadlines from contributors. However, a less formal governance is also hypothesized to increase development effort due to a more cumbersome coordination overhead. The verification of research hypotheses is based on empirical data from a sample of 75 major OS projects. Empirical evidence supports our hypotheses and suggests that software quality, mainly measured as coupling and inheritance, does not increase development effort, but represents an important managerial variable to implement the more open governance approach that characterizes OS projects which, in turn, increases development effort.

Previous research has addressed motivations of individuals and the ways they engage with OSS projects. However, there is a lack of research which examines and explains work practices used by companies in their engagement with projects. Work practices used by companies to contribute to five established OSS projects are investigated through examination of the actions of employees in public communication channels and draw on our experiences when analysing engagement with the same projects. We find that companies utilise work practices for contributing which are congruent with the circumstances and their capabilities that support their short and long term needs. We find that companies contribute to OSS projects in different ways, such as employing core project developers, making donations, and joining project steering committees in order to advance strategic interests.

   Abstract = {While research has extensively studied the group of voluntary contributors and their motivation to participate in open source software (OSS) development, we lack an understanding of how firm-sponsored developers behave when they work for an OSS project. In specific, firm-sponsored developers may face identification conflicts arising from different social norms and beliefs inherent in both the organizational culture of their employing company and dominant OSS cultures. These conflicts may induce developer turnover intention towards the organization and the OSS community. This research seeks to identify identification-related determinants that drive turnover intention by surveying Linux kernel developers (N=321). This study finds, among others, that perceived external reputation of the employing organization reduces turnover intention towards the company while perceived own reputation dampens turnover intention directed towards the OSS community.},

   Abstract = {The software stack opened under Open Source Software (OSS) licenses is growing rapidly. Commercial actors have released considerable amounts of previously proprietary source code. These actions beg the question why companies choose a strategy based on giving away software assets'? Research on outbound OSS approach has tried to answer this question with the concept of the "OSS business model". When studying the reasons for code release, we have observed that the business model concept is too generic to capture the many incentives organizations have. Conversely, in this paper we investigate empirically what the companies' incentives are by means of an exploratory case study of three organizations in different stages of their code release. Our results indicate that the companies aim to promote standardization, obtain development resources, gain cost savings, improve the quality of software, increase the trustworthiness of software, or steer OSS communities. We conclude that future research on outbound OSS could benefit from focusing on the heterogeneous incentives for code release rather than on revenue models.},

   Abstract = {Software vendors need to manage the dependencies of the open source components used in their products. Without this management, license compliance would be impossible, export restrictions could not be maintained, and security vulnerabilities would remain unknown to the vendor.  The management of these dependencies has grown in an ad-hoc fashion in most companies. As such, vendors find it hard to learn from each other and improve practices.  To address this problem, we performed exploratory single-case study research at one large established software vendor. We gathered and analyzed the key challenges of tracking and documenting open source dependencies in products. We wanted to understand whether these ad-hoc solutions could be based on a single unified conceptual model for managing dependencies.  Our study suggests that underlying the various point solutions that we found at this vendor lies a conceptual model that we tentatively call the product (architecture) model. In future cross-vendor work, we will investigate whether this conceptual model can be expanded to become a unifying model for all open source dependency management.},

Companies may take the lead in developing FLOSS rather than volunteers, which may change the nature of FLOSS development and affect the FLOSS community. Despite substantial research on commercial participation, it remains unclear whether companies dominate FLOSS development, to what extent the domination exists and whether the domination affects the FLOSS community. We therefore conduct an empirical study on OpenStack with a focus on its four main projects (Nova, Swift, Glance, and Neutron) to explore the commercial domination. We employ the development data of the four projects to quantify companies' contributions from two aspects: the developers they provided and the commits made by those developers. We find that there are nearly half of the versions, in which the four projects are dominated by one company. The dominant companies change occasionally, but the number never exceeds three for any project. We found that the commercial domination is negatively associated with the participation of companies and contributors, while it is positively associated with the productivity of contributors and the quality of issue reports. Our study contributes to the understanding of commercial domination and its impact on FLOSS community. Our findings reveal the adverse consequences brought by commercial domination in addition to its benefits.

What is the nature of these novel arrangements? Does volunteers’ participation remain critical for these ecosystems? Despite extensive research on commercial participation in OSS, the exact nature and extent of company contributions to OSS development, and the impact of this engagement may have on the volunteer community have not been clarified. To bridge the gap, we perform an exploratory study of OpenStack: a large OSS ecosystem with intense commercial participation. We quantify companies’ contributions via the developers that they provide and the commits made by those developers. We find that companies made far more contributions than volunteers and the distribution of the contributions made by different companies is also highly unbalanced. We observe eight unique contribution models based on companies’ commercial objectives and characterize each model according to three dimensions: contribution intensity, extent, and focus. Companies providing full cloud solutions tend to make both intensive (more than other companies) and extensive (involving a wider variety of projects) contributions. Usage-oriented companies make extensive but less intense contributions. Companies driven by particular business needs focus their contributions on the specific projects addressing these needs. Minor contributors include community players (e.g., the Linux Foundation) and research groups. A model relating the number of volunteers to the diversity of contribution shows a strong positive association between them.

   Abstract = {This paper analyzes the competitive strategy of a proprietary software (PS) firm in the presence of open source software (OSS) where the copyright holder has granted software users access and use of OSS without any obligation regarding source code disclosure and royalty payments. The OSS is developed by volunteer programmers, while the firm incurs costs to hire programmers to build the PS. The firm has a quality advantage because, first, it can provide professional technical support and promotion, and second, it is difficult for the OS community to collaborate for the production and maintenance of the OSS. The analysis is based on two scenarios: (1) the OSS is available free of charge; (2) the OSS is distributed by fringe vendors who can provide OSS quality upgrades. We find that both types of software can coexist in equilibrium. Furthermore, despite the fact that PS enjoys a quality advantage, it will optimally set a lower quality than OSS. The comparative statics show that a change in each market parameter can lead the firm to simultaneously increase (or decrease) both the PS price and quality. We consequently evaluate the impact on the firm’s profit and consumer surplus. © 2020, Society for Economic Research on Copyright Issues. All rights reserved.},

   Abstract = {Firm participation in open source software (OSS) development is a noteworthy phenomenon and includes two types of firm-participating OSS projects: community founded (developed from an open project) and spinout (spun out from an information technology firm's internal project). OSS project leaders implement quality controls to improve the quality of developed products. They may not be aware that their implementation of quality controls produces a side effect-quality controls signal unobservable project quality to volunteers and promote volunteers' continued participation intentions (VCPI).We focus on two quality controls-accreditation and code acceptance, which, respectively, map to the input and output quality of an OSS project-and compare their respective effects on VCPI in community-founded and spinout projects.We propose that accreditation and code acceptance influence VCPI by signaling unobservable input and output quality to volunteers. As we focus on continued participation, we theorize as to how volunteers' tenure in OSS projects moderates the relationships between the signaling effects of input and output quality controls and VCPI. Furthermore, we theorize as to how the OSS project type moderates the effects of quality controls on VCPI. We surveyed 304 volunteers from 40 OSS projects and constructed a two-level model of project and developer factors to explain VCPI. Our findings indicate that both accreditation and code acceptance enhance VCPI. The signaling effects on VCPI associated with accreditation decline with volunteer tenure, but those associated with code acceptance do not. Accreditation and code acceptance influence VCPI, with community-founded projects exhibitingweaker direct positive effects and spinout projects exhibiting stronger direct positive effects. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2017 INFORMS.},

   Abstract = {Background. It is currently unknown how software ecosystem health affects the financial performance of open source companies. This is a problem, because open source is becoming increasingly popular and more knowledge is necessary for companies on how to capitalize on this phenomenon. Objectives. With this paper, insight is developed into the relation between software ecosystem health and financial performance of the open source company that nurtures it. Method. A case study on two open source companies, Cloudera and Hortonworks, is performed. The software ecosystem health and financial performance of both companies are assessed. Results. Cloudera is healthier in terms of robustness and niche creation, while Hortonworks is healthier in terms of productivity. Financially, Cloudera performs better than Hortonworks. Conclusion. The following hypotheses are formulated. Software ecosystem health has an expected positive relation with financial performance. Niche creation health is the main contributor to this relation, robustness health is a minor reason for this relation, and software ecosystem productivity health has little to no influence.

   Abstract = {When using the open source software (OSS), development model firms face the challenge to balance the tension between the integration of knowledge from external individuals and the desire for control. In our investigation, we draw upon a data set consisting of 109 projects with 912 individual programmers and 110 involved firms and show how those different projects are governed in terms of project leadership. Our four hypotheses show that despite the wish for external knowledge from voluntary programmers firms are relying on own resources or those from other firms to control a project, that projects with low firm participation are mainly led by voluntary committers, and that projects with high firm participation are mainly led by paid leaders. This research extends the dominating literature by providing empirical evidence in that area and helps to deepen our understanding of firm participation in OSS projects as a form of open innovation activity. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

The study of its evolution provides evidence of the sustainability of its process: increasing amounts of provided effort by developers correspond to similarly increasing produced outputs to the Moodle system. It is also evident how this OSS system, apart from achieving the transition to a successful multisite, collaborative and community-based OSS project, depends more on its community than its commercial partners.},

   Abstract = {Open Source Software (OSS) has come to play a critical role in the software industry. Some large ecosystems enjoy the participation of large numbers of companies, each of which has its own focus and goals. Indeed, companies that otherwise compete, may become collaborators within the OSS ecosystem they participate in. Prior research has largely focused on commercial involvement in OSS projects, but there is a scarcity of research focusing on company collaborations within OSS ecosystems. Some of these ecosystems have become critical building blocks for organizations worldwide; hence, a clear understanding of how companies collaborate within large ecosystems is essential. This paper presents the results of an empirical study of the OpenStack ecosystem, in which hundreds of companies collaborate on thousands of project repositories to deliver cloud distributions. Based on a detailed analysis, we identify clusters of collaborations, and identify four strategies that companies adopt to engage with the OpenStack ecosystem. We alsofind that companies may engage in intentional or passive collaborations, or may work in an isolated fashion. Further, wefi nd that a com-pany's position in the collaboration network is positively associated with its productivity in OpenStack. Our study sheds light on howlarge OSS ecosystems work, and in particular on the patterns of collaboration within one such large ecosystem.

A matrix differentiating four types of OSSDPs: firm- versus community-initiated projects and one participating firm (single-vendor projects) versus many firms (multivendor projects), and accompanying hypotheses regarding a firm's participation for each type are developed. Using data from 83 Eclipse projects to test the hypotheses, findings indicate that (1) firms more actively employ both leadership and resource deployment in firm-initiated projects than in community-initiated ones and (2) firms are more likely to use resource deployment control over leadership control in multivendor projects. Key theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2015 .},

Previous research has addressed the motivations of both individuals and companies to engage with OSS projects. However, limited research has been undertaken that examines and explains the practical mechanisms or work practices used by companies and their developers to pursue their commercial and technical objectives when engaging with OSS projects. This research investigates the variety of work practices used in public communication channels by company contributors to engage with and contribute to eight community OSS projects. Through interviews with contributors to the eight projects we draw on their experiences and insights to explore the motivations to use particular methods of contribution. We find that companies utilise work practices for contributing to community projects which are congruent with the circumstances and their capabilities that support their short- and long-term needs. We also find that companies contribute to community OSS projects in ways that may not always be apparent from public sources, such as employing core project developers, making donations, and joining project steering committees in order to advance strategic interests. The factors influencing contributor work practices can be complex and are often dynamic arising from considerations such as company and project structure, as well as technical concerns and commercial strategies. The business context in which software created by the OSS project is deployed is also found to influence contributor work practices.

   Abstract = {This paper examines the within-industry diversification of software small and medium enterprises that collaborate with the open source software community (OSS SMEs). In doing so, it offers new insights into the association between open innovation and diversification. We rely on arguments inspired by the literature and evidence collected through interviews with OSS SMEs' top managers to investigate factors that favor or hinder within-industry diversification. First, in line with the mainstream diversification literature, we focus attention on the role of firm size. Second, in the spirit of the open innovation research, we concentrate on the mechanisms that OSS SMEs put in place to get access to the external resources of the OSS community. Econometric evidence on 100 European OSS SMEs shows that firm size is negatively associated to within-industry diversification, while OSS SMEs that have contributed to a larger number of OSS projects have a more diversified portfolio of software products. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that the practice of authorizing firm programmers to contribute autonomously to OSS projects of their own choice during working hours may be positively associated to within-industry diversification only if OSS SMEs possess adequate internal technological resources. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

   Abstract = {Do open source software (OSS) projects represent a new innovation model? Under what conditions can it be employed in other contexts? “Collective invention” regimes usually ended when a dominant design emerged. This is not the case with OSS. Firstly, the OSS community developed the institutional innovation of OSS licenses enabling OSS software to survive as a common property. Secondly, these licenses are mainly enforced by pro-socially motivated contributors. We characterize the conditions under which OSS communities develop and sustain pro-social commitments. We point out the vulnerability of these conditions to developments in patent legislation.},

   Abstract = {This paper presents a psychological contract perspective on the use of the open source development model as a global sourcing strategy-opensourcing, as we term it here-whereby commerical companies and open source communities collaborate on development of software of commercial interest to the company. Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived. The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had "liberated" what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product. We followed this with a large-scale survey involving additional exemplars of the phenomenon. The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success. We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary. Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness: The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem. The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises. It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.},

   Abstract = {There are many different ways in which Open Source ideas can be adopted by business, and influence the way in which companies do business. A number of different surveys have been conducted in different countries with the purpose of understanding the state of practice with respect to Open Source in companies. A number of different business models have been observed, ranging from the use of Open Source infrastructure products to basing a company’s entire business model on Open Source. In this paper we report on a study of the perceptions of Open Source and the uptake of open source products and development models in Swedish companies. We investigate this from the standpoint of stakeholders in those companies which have an expressed interest in Open Source, allowing a more in-depth analysis of the extent to which Open Source has influenced business thinking. From our analysis we find that uptake is much higher than reported in earlier studies, but is still concentrated in SMEs, consistent with the findings of previous studies. There is increased evidence of interest beyond the simple use of OS components at the (LAMP) infrastructure level. In particular, a significant proportion of the companies are in a symbiotic relationship with the OS community, supporting both through participation in existing projects and the release of new software under OS licences.},

   Abstract = {Today, all firms using or developing software are facing the question if and how to engage in open source software (OSS). Yet, little is known about the process of OSS adoption and diffusion within corporations. We address this issue. In light of qualitative evidence on the role of programmers in promoting OSS, we focus on the attitudes of employed IT professionals towards corporate OSS engagement. Our analysis is based on 25 interviews and a large-scale survey with 404 participants, performed at the telecommunications department of a multinational company and guided by the theoretical frameworks of Rogers (innovation diffusion) and Davis (Technology Acceptance Model). Our main findings concern the impact of the respondent's job function. They are consistent with theoretical considerations - and still rather surprising. Distinguishing between developers, testers, architects, project managers, and managers, we find that software testers are generally most favorable towards heightening OSS activities, followed by software architects and managers. Apart from project managers, developers are actually least favorable towards increased corporate OSS engagement, despite their large experience in working on OSS. Since developers constitute both the basic level of software development and the largest of the named groups, this finding leads us to question that OSS is a generally supported grassroots movement. Introducing OSS and open innovation processes to a corporation thus requires taking each individual's incentives based on her job function into account, and a close look at organizational aspects.},

   Abstract = {Purpose: Interorganizational reciprocity plays a key role in relationships among software firms and open source communities. This study seeks to illuminate how a firm's open source strategy, characterized by its participation in the open source community, contributes to its financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the norm of reciprocity and social capital theory, the study proposes a model comprising the behavioral antecedents and business results of a firm's symbiotic relationship with the open source community. Data were collected through a survey. Partial least squares-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to assess the results. Findings: A firm's participative behaviors can have three dimensions: technology giving, technology taking and social participation. Technology taking directly impacts financial performance, whereas the effects of technology giving and social participation on financial performance are fully mediated by the firm's symbiotic relationship with the open source community. Practical implications: Managers can understand how a specific behavior ultimately contributes to a symbiotic relationship or a firm's financial performance and how to flexibly align participation strategies with the business orientation. Originality/value: The study adds to the open source literature by refining and enriching the conceptual domain of a firm's participative behaviors in open source communities. It also reveals how contrasting behavioral strategies impact a firm's financial performance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

   Abstract = {Free / Libre open source software (FLOSS/OSS) has gained increasing popularity and utilisation in commercial and governmental organisations. Universities like Harvard and Stanford now offer courses on open source as a business and also on how businesses can compete with open source firms. However, very little research has been published in regards to the influence of OSS on business strategies; the use of OSS as a viable business or its value proposition within a commercial entity. The business model, a powerful tool for extracting economic value from the potential of technological innovation, clearly plays an important role in the success of a business. In this paper we investigate the role of open source in the business models of Red Hat and IBM and describe how OSS has contributed to their success. A framework recently developed by some of the authors is used to evaluate and identify the key factors important to the integration of OSS strategies into traditional business models.},

Using a commercial open source approach, firms can get to market faster with a superior product at lower cost than possible for traditional competitors. The paper shows how these benefits accrue from an engaged and self-supporting user community. Lacking any prior comprehensive reference, this paper is based on an analysis of public statements by practitioners of commercial open source.

   Abstract = {Corporate involvement in open source software (OSS) communities has increased substantially in recent years. Often this takes the form of company employees devoting their time to contribute code to the efforts of projects in these communities. Ideology has traditionally served to motivate, coordinate, and guide volunteer contributions to OSS communities. As employees represent an increasing proportion of the participants in OSS communities, the role of OSS ideology in guiding their commitment and code contributions is unknown. In this research, we argue that OSS ideology misfit has important implications for companies and the OSS communities to which their employees contribute, since their engagement in such communities is not necessarily voluntary. We conceptualize two different types of misfit: OSS ideology under-fit, whereby an employee embraces an OSS ideology more than their coworkers or OSS community do, and OSS ideology over-fit, whereby an employee perceives that their coworkers or OSS community embrace the OSS ideology more strongly than the employee does. To develop a set of hypotheses about the implications of these two types of misfit for employee commitment to the company and commitment to the OSS community, we draw on self-determination theory. We test the hypotheses in a field study of 186 employees who participate in an OSS community. We find that OSS ideology under-fit impacts the company and the community in the same way: it decreases employee commitment to the company and commitment to the OSS community. In contrast, we find that OSS ideology over-fit increases commitment to the company but decreases commitment to the OSS community. Finally, we find that employees’ commitment to their company reinforces the impact of their commitment to the OSS community in driving ongoing code contributions. This provides a holistic view of OSS ideology and its impacts among an increasingly pervasive yet understudied type of participant in OSS research. It provides insights for companies that are considering assigning their employees to work in OSS communities as well as for OSS communities that are partnering with these companies.},

[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT];The emerging work on understanding open source software has questioned what leads to effectiveness in OSS development teams in the absence of formal controls, and it has pointed to the importance of ideology. This paper develops a framework of the OSS community ideology (including specific norms, beliefs, and values) and a theoretical model to show how adherence to components of the ideology impacts effectiveness in OSS teams. The model is based on the idea that the tenets of the OSS ideology motivate behaviors that enhance cognitive trust and communication quality and encourage identification with the project team, which enhances affective trust. Trust and communication in turn impact OSS team effectiveness. The research considers two kinds of effectiveness in OSS teams: the attraction and retention of developer input and the generation of project outputs. Hypotheses regarding antecedents to each are developed. Hypotheses are tested using survey and objective data on OSS projects. Results support the main thesis that OSS team members' adherence to the tenets of the OSS community ideology impacts OSS team effectiveness and reveal that different components impact effectiveness in different ways. Of particular interest is the finding that adherence to some ideological components was beneficial to the effectiveness of the team in terms of attracting and retaining input, but detrimental to the output of the team.

   Abstract = {Innovative uses of ICTs can bring about development. The open source software movement offers new opportunities for innovation. In particular, the use of such platforms can enable entrepreneurs in low resource environments to access and use needed software to support their new businesses. This paper investigates the role of open source software for development. This research shows that participation in open source communities is significantly correlated with new business formation. Through an analysis of datasets from the World Bank and GitHub, the largest open source platform, this paper finds a relationship between open source participation, new business formation and their effects on development, through unemployment rates. There is a strong, positive correlation between new business registrations and active GitHub users, which was statistically significant. The implications for development are in the effect of a positive relationship in job creation based on business formation and open source participation. © 2017 AIS/ICIS Administrative Office.

   Abstract = {Single-vendor commercial open source software projects are open source software projects that are owned by a single firm that derives a direct and significant revenue stream from the software. Single-vendor commercial open source at first glance represents an economic paradox: How can a firm earn money if it is making its product available for free as open source? This paper presents the core properties of single-vendor open source business models and discusses how they work. Using a single-vendor open source approach, firms can get to market faster with a superior product at lower cost than possible for traditional competitors. The paper shows how these benefits accrue from an engaged and self-supporting user community. Lacking any prior comprehensive reference, this paper is based on an analysis of public statements by practitioners of single-vendor open source. It forges the various anecdotes into a coherent description of revenue generation strategies and relevant business functions.},

   Abstract = {This study examined how participation in open innovation communities influences the innovative and financial performance of firms commercializing open source software. Using an original dataset of open source companies in the Netherlands, I found that the community participation-performance relationship is curvilinear. In addition, results indicate that extensive technical participation in open source projects is more strongly related to performance for firms that also engage in social ("offline") community activities, for companies of larger size, and for firms with high R&D intensities. Overall, this research refines our understanding of the boundary conditions under which engagement in community-based innovation yields private returns to commercial actors. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

   Abstract = {Many researchers have pointed out that the open source movement is an interesting phenomenon that is difficult to explain with conventional economic theories. However, while there is no shortage on research on individuals' motivation for contributing to open source, few have investigated the commercial companies' motivations for doing the same. A case study was conducted at three different companies from the IT service industry, to investigate three possible drivers: sale of complimentary services, innovation and opensourcing (outsourcing). We offer three conclusions. First, we identified three main drivers for contributing to open source, which are (a) selling complimentary services, (b) building greater innovative capability and (c) cost reduction through opensourcing to an external community. Second, while previous research has documented that the most important driver is selling complimentary services, we found that this picture is too simple. Our evidence points to a broader set of motivations, in the sense that all our cases exhibit combinations of the three drivers. Finally, our findings suggest that there might be a shift in how commercial companies view open source software. The companies interviewed have all expressed a moral obligation to contribute to open source.
